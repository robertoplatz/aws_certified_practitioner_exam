# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

## Understanding Your AWS Account

### Introduction

There are going to be two account-level things you want to be clear about:

* What’s it all going to cost you? Because cloud services are scalable, there’s virtually no limit to how much of them you can purchase, or to how much they can cost you. If something isn’t going according to plan, you’ll want to know what it is and how to pull its plug as soon as possible.
* Who’s running the show? In other words, who has the authority to make the big decisions about firing up and shutting down account resources? In addition to the fact that those decisions will have significant financial implications, they’ll also define your organization’s public presence.

Monitoring and keeping a lid on costs is what you’re going to learn about here. What you’ll see will include the following:

* Taking advantage of the AWS Free Tier
* Understanding how AWS services are priced and how to model pricing for complicated combinations (or stacks) of resources
* Understanding the usage limits AWS places on some services and how to raise those
  limits
* Keeping on top of your actual account costs

### The Free Tier

* AWS offers a generous Free Tier for the first 12 months after opening a new account.
* Under the Free Tier, you can freely experiment with light versions of most AWS services without being billed.

#### How Does the Free Tier Work?

* You’re allowed to run a t2.micro Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instance—powered by either Linux or
  Windows—for up to 750 hours per month.
* You can effectively keep a low-demand website going without interruption for your full first year.
* You don’t have to consume those 750 Free Tier EC2 hours by running a single instance 24/7.
* You can experiment a high-availability deployment involving running two or four concurrent instances for a few
  hours to test resilient failover architectures.
* As long as the total monthly hours of run time don’t exceed 750, your credit card won’t be billed.
* You can run lightweight relational database workloads under Amazon’s
  Relational Database Service (RDS) in any combination for up to 750 hours per month.
* You can store up to 5 GB of data within Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets.
* You’ll be billed for the excess amount at normal AWS billing rates.
* Free Tier–eligible t2.micro instances (using Linux) on EC2 running in the US East
  region for, say, 850 hours through a single month would cost you only $1.16 USD at current
  rates ($0.0116/hour).

#### Tracking Your Free Tier Usage

* You can accidentally leaving AWS resources running—whether you’re enjoying the Free Tier or not.
* Firing up a synchronously replicated RDS database instance to test your new website backend and then forgetting all about it can easily cost you thousands of dollars a month.

We’ll show you two ways to monitor your usage specifically in relation to your Free Tier limits.

* The first approach involves nothing more than waiting for messages to arrive in your email box.
* By default, Free Tier–related email alerts are automatically sent whenever account activity approaches or has passed Free Tier limits.

#### Billing Dashboard
* Go to Billing Dashboard, in Bill Preferences menu item, you can change or disable your email address.

#### Tracking tool

* The second tracking tool will appear toward the bottom of the Billing Dashboard for any account that’s still Free Tier–eligible.
* Figure below shows you what such a usage tracking tool will look like.

#### What’s Available Under the Free Tier?

There are actually two kinds of free services:

* Light implementations of most AWS services that are available through the first 12 months of a new AWS account;
* Light usage of certain AWS services that are always available—even after your initial 12 months are up

You can get a detailed rundown of everything that’s available for both classes at https://aws.amazon.com/free .

#### The 12-Month Free Tier

|  The 12-Month Free Tier                                      |                        |   
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
|  Amazon EC2 - 750hrs;                 |  Amazon EFS - 5GB;    |   
|  Amazon S3 - 5GB;                     |  Amazon ECR - 500MB;  |
|  Amazon RDS - 750hrs;                 |  Amazon MQ - 750hrs;  |
|  Amazon API Gateway - 1million/month; |  Amazon ELB - 750hrs; | 
|  Amazon CloudFront - 50GB;            |                        |


* We’ve already discussed running low-powered EC2 and RDS instances and using 5 GB of S3 storage capacity under the Free Tier.
* 30 GB of either magnetic or solid-state drive (SSD) volumes from Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS).
* EBS volumes are usually used as the primary data drives for EC2 instances. For context, 8 GB is normally more than enough space to run the Linux OS driving a busy web server.
* 500 MB/month of free storage on the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
* ECR is a service for storing and managing Docker container images.
* 50 GB of outbound data transfers and 2 million HTTP or HTTPS requests for Amazon CloudFront distributions.(These are annual rather than monthly amounts.)
* CloudFront is Amazon’s content delivery network that you can use to serve cached copies of your content to remote users at low latency rates.
* One million API calls/month on Amazon API Gateway. API Gateway is a tool for managing your organization’s application programming interfaces (APIs).
* APIs allow users and applications to connect with mobile and web-based resources.

#### Permanently Free Services

Some AWS services can be useful even when consumed at levels so low that they don’t need to be billed.

* 10 custom monitoring metrics and 10 alarms on Amazon CloudWatch active at any given time. You use CloudWatch either directly or in combination with other tools to track resource performance and costs.
* 10 GB of data retrievals from Amazon Glacier per month. Glacier is a low-cost storage service that’s ideal for long-term storage where you’re not likely to require quick access to your data.
* 62,000 outbound email messages per month using Amazon Simple Email Service  (SES).
* SES is an enterprise-scale email service geared to organizations that regularly  send large volumes of emails.
* One million requests and 3.2 million seconds of compute time for AWS Lambda functions.
* Lambda lets you run code in response to network-based triggers without having to worry about provisioning any underlying server infrastructure.

AWS Free Tier benefits do not apply to resources launched in the GovCloud (US) region or through an AWS Organizations member account.


### Product Pricing

As you plan, launch, and then manage your AWS deployments, keeping costs within your organization’s budget is going to demand a lot of your attention.

You’ll need to understand how AWS bills for each of the services you’re considering, and you’ll need to know how to quickly get your hands on accurate pricing information.

#### Finding AWS Pricing Documentation

* Each AWS service has its own web page dedicated to pricing.
* For example, bearing in mind that the URL for an introductory overview of the  S3 service is https://aws.amazon.com/s3, to get to the pricing page, you simply add a slash and the word pricing, like this: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing
* Pricing can vary between AWS Regions

Example with S3:

* S3 page lists the cost of usage measured by metrics such as storage,  requests, data transfers, and cross-region replication.
* Selecting a different AWS Region from the drop-down will sometimes display significant differences across the global AWS infrastructure.
* Note the costs of the various storage tiers and—when applicable—how those rates change at various volume levels like 0–50  TB/month or 50–500 TB/month.

Example with EC2:

* EC2 pricing page (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing) lets you choose
  between:
  * on-demand, 
  * spot, 
  * reserve instances, and 
  * dedicated hosts pricing
* You’ll also need to select the operating system you’ll be using with your instance. Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server licensing costs are included in the  hourly EC2 rates.
* With those choices made, you’ll be shown the per-hour cost for each instance type.

#### Calculate Monthly Costs for an EC2 Instance

Let's try using the EC2 pricing page to figure out how much it would cost you to run an on demand compute-optimized c5.18xlarge instance type with a 20 GB EBS storage volume in the US East region. 

Compare the costs of both Linux and Windows instances:

1. Open the EC2 pricing page (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing), and select See  On-Demand Pricing.
2. Select the US East (N. Virginia) region.
3. Select the Linux tab.
4. Scroll down the list until you get to the c5.18xlarge line. Note the Per Hour value.
5. Multiply that value by 750, which is (more or less) the number of hours in a month.
6. Open the EBS pricing page (https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing), and select the  US East (N. Virginia) region.
7. Find the Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD line, and note the Per GB-Month value.
8. Multiply that value by 20 (the desired size of your storage volume), and add that to the EC2 instance type value.
9. Repeat steps 1–8, but select the Windows tab in step 3.
10. Compare the results.
    
#### Working with Online Calculators

AWS provides two regularly updated modeling tools: 

* the Simple Monthly Calculator to help you understand what running any combination of AWS resources will cost you;
* Total Cost of Ownership Calculator to closely compare what you’re currently paying for on-premises servers with what the same workload would cost on AWS.

#### AWS Simple Monthly Calculator

* You’ll find the Simple Monthly Calculator on the internet at http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
* Down the left side of the page are tabs for each of the AWS services for which the calculator works.
* When you choose a tab, you’ll find forms where you can input data representing the usage you plan for that service.
* The monthly cost for that instance will appear to the right, while the running total monthly amount will be updated in the Estimate tab at the top of the page.

* You can also select or deselect the Free Usage Tier option to tailor results to the current status of your account—the calculator isn’t connected to and doesn’t get any data from your account.
* Down the column on the right side of the page is a small collection of templates for common deployment scenarios.

* The Disaster Recovery And Backup sample, for instance, estimates costs for running Linux database servers on EC2 in four geographically distinct regions and maintaining 500 GB of storage in Amazon S3.
* Choosing the Export To CSV button will allow you to download a comma-separated values spreadsheet containing your profile data.
* The Save And Share button will provide you with a web address pointing to a permanent copy of your results. You can use this to share with those same colleagues and clients.


#### Build a Deployment Cost Estimate Using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator

1. Open the calculator page at http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
2. Deselect the Free Usage Tier check box at the top.
3. Choose the US West (Oregon) region from the drop-down menu.
4. With the Amazon EC2 tab on the left selected, choose the green + button to add a new row to the Compute: Amazon EC2 Instances.
5. Type a description in the Description field (perhaps something like WordPress web server).
6. Enter 2 in the Instances field to tell the calculator that you’ll be running two identical instances.
7. Choose the Usage drop-down and select Hours/Month, and then enter 750 as the value. This means you’ll be running the servers 24/7 through the entire month.
8. Choose in the Type field, and select the Linux radio button at the top and then c5.large in the list below. You might need to scroll down a bit to get to it. Choose Close And Save.
9. Choose in the Billing Option field, and select 3 Yr No Upfront Reserved to set the way you’ll be paying. Choose Close And Save. You should see your Monthly cost at about $26.28.
10. Choose the Add New Row button in the Storage: Amazon EBS Volumes row, enter  2 for Volumes, and leave the General Purpose SSD default value as it is. Enter 100 GB for Storage (that will be the size of the EBS volume you’ll have attached to  each instance).
11. Feel free to add other features either on the EC2 page or on any other page. Then choose the Estimate tab at the top and view your cost breakdown by maximizing
    each item. When you’re done, export the estimate to a CSV file, and then choose Save And Share to get a shareable URL.

### AWS Total Cost of Ownership Calculator

* You can get things going by pointing your browser to https://aws.amazon.com/tco-calculator
* The idea is that you enter the configuration specifications of your current on-premises or colocation deployment, and the calculator will produce a detailed, itemized estimate of what that workload is costing you in its current location and what it would cost on AWS.

|          | On-premises | AWS      |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Server   | $373,457    | $229,848 |
| Storage  | $78,070     | $18,633  |
| Network  | $96,303     | $37,525  |
| IT-Labor | $6,885      | $24,772  |
| Total    | $554,715    | $310,778 |

The calculator incorporates estimates of capital infrastructure expenses including:
* the amortized costs of servers, 
* networking hardware,
* electricity, 
* cooling, 
* and maintenance, 
* as well as the costs of an AWS business support plan.

#### Compare the On-Premises Costs of Running Your Application with AWS Costs

1. Select a currency and either On-Premises or Colocation to describe who is currently hosting your servers.
2. Select the AWS Region that would make the most sense for your cloud deployment and then whether you’re currently running your workload on physical severs or  on virtual machines (like VMware virtual machines or Docker containers, which, of course, are themselves running on physical machines).
3. Enter the hardware configuration of your nondatabase servers in the Servers row, and then choose Add Row to display a second row where you can enter your databaseservers’ configuration, including the database engine (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.) you’re running.
4. Enter the type and amount of data storage you’re currently using. When you’re done, choose the Calculate TCO button.
5. Read through the output and, if you like, choose the Download Report button to get a permanent copy. You’ll have to provide your personal information so AWS and its partners can contact you. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because you’ll likely end up getting a serious conversation with a solutions architect out of the deal.

### Service Limits

* It’s hard to even visualize just how much compute and storage capacity is available for its customers.
* And the scalability of its design means that there shouldn’t be a practical ceiling on how much infrastructure any customer is able to access on demand.
* AWS imposes limits on the scope of resources you can use.

* you’re allowed to run only 20 on-demand and 20 reserved instances of the EC2 m5.large instance type at any one time within a single AWS Region.

* This would seem to reflect Amazon’s desire to ensure that all classes of resources should be reliably available to meet new demand and not all held by a few large customers.

* it can also protect customers from having automated processes accidentally (or maliciously) launch resources that generate unsustainable costs.

* You can find the complete and up-to-date list of service limits on this AWS documentation page: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html


### Billing and Cost Management

* Besides the performance of your infrastructure resources like EC2 instances, you’ll want to keep a close watch on the account itself.
* The various tools found in your Billing Dashboard can help with this account oversight.

#### The AWS Billing Dashboard

* The main Billing & Cost Management Dashboard contains a helpful visual Spend Summary that displays your costs from the previous and current months so far, along with a forecast of the costs you’ll likely face through the end of the month.
* There’s also a Month-to-Date Spend By Service display from which choosing the Bill Details button will take you to an itemized breakdown of your current spending.
* The Billing Dashboard also includes links to pages where you can set payment methods and enter your organization’s tax information.
* The Payment History link provides records of your previous transactions.


#### AWS Budgets

* An AWS budget is a tool for tracking a specified set of events so that when a preset threshold is approached or passed, an alert—perhaps an email—is triggered.

You can create one of three budget types:

* Cost budget to monitor costs being incurred against your account
* Usage budget to track particular categories of resource consumption
* Reservation budget to help you understand the status of any active EC2, RDS, Redshift, or Elasticache reserve instances you might have.

The budget setup process has two parts:
* Set the terms of your budget—meaning, what it is that you’re tracking.
* Define how and when you want alerts sent.

#### Create a Cost Budget to Track Spending

In this exercise, you’ll configure a budget that will alert you by email whenever your monthly account spend threatens to exceed your limit. This can be particularly useful to protect your account against an attack that launches unauthorized resources:
1. While logged into your account as the root user, choose Create Budget on the Budgets page and select Cost Budget.
2. Give your budget a name, leave Period at Monthly, and enter a Budgeted amount that’s a bit higher than the maximum monthly spend you want to permit your  account. You can leave the rest of the settings at their defaults, which will track all account costs. Choose Configure Alerts.
3. Leave the Alert Based On value as Actual Costs, and add a percentage of 80% to the % Of Budgeted Amount field. This will trigger the alert when your actual monthly spend hits 80 percent of your maximum.
4. Enter at least one email contact, and then choose Confirm Budget. Review the settings and, if you’re happy, choose Create.

#### Monitoring Your Costs

* Just like smart security professionals will build layers of firewalls, permissions, and physical controls around their application infrastructure, account administrators  will also watch events from multiple perspectives.
* Ongoing monitoring is a key part of that mix, and that means getting to know Amazon’s Cost Explorer and its cost and usage reports.


#### Monitoring Your Costs
##### Cost Explorer

* Cost Explorer (https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer) lets you build graphs to visualize your account’s historical and current costs.
* you can select one of the preconfigured views provided by the service (including spending over the most recent three months by service).
* you can launch the Cost Explorer tool to open a heavily customizable view that lets you filter account cost events by date, region, Availability Zone, instance type, platform (Linux, Windows, and so on), and others.
* CSV-formatted files based on customized views can also be downloaded.

#### Monitoring Your Costs
##### Cost and Usage Reports

* Cost and usage reports are (right now, at least) accessed from the Reports link on the Billing Dashboard.
* You can configure reports to be created that include the full range of activity on your account, including what resources you have running and how much they’re costing you.
* You can control for the level of detail and enable support for Redshift and/or Amazon QuickSight (a managed, pay-per-user business intelligence tool) to handle the visualization and analysis of what can become significant volumes of data.
* The reports, once generated at preset intervals, are compressed, saved using the CSV format, and sent to an S3 bucket you’ve already created.
* it’s up to you to configure Redshift or QuickSight to access and process the data as it’s generated.

#### Monitoring Your Costs
##### Cost Allocation Tags

* Tags are metadata identification elements representing a resource and its actions.
* Tags can be used to organize and track your resources, allowing you to visualize and better understand how resources are being used.


`Resource tags` Resource tags are often used in busy accounts to help administrators
quickly identify the purpose and owner of a particular running resource. With hundreds of
instances, security groups, buckets, and service definitions scattered through your account,
being able to instantly understand what each one is supposed to do will make it a lot easier
for you to know how you should manage it.


`Cost allocation tags` Cost tags are only meant to interact with billing tools and won’t
show up in the context of any other AWS resource or process. Like resource tags, cost
allocation tags help you efficiently identify your resources, but only for the purpose of
tracking your account spending.

You should also know that there are two kinds of cost allocation tags: 
* AWS-generated cost allocation tags, which AWS automatically generates when resources are created, and 
* user-defined cost allocation tags.


#### AWS Organizations

* Formerly known as Consolidated Billing, AWS Organizations allows you to centralize the administration of multiple AWS accounts owned or controlled by a single company.
* Being able to control the allocation of resource permissions, security, and spending from a single pane of glass is a big deal. 
* It’s also a convenient way to manage payments.
* Just remember that, once accounts are linked, maintaining a secure profile and following best practices becomes even more critical than for stand-alone accounts.
* After all, a security breach of any one linked account runs the risk of spreading the vulnerability to everything running in any of your accounts.

### Summary

* The Free Tier offers new accounts a full year of free access to light configurations of most AWS services.
* You can track how close you are to “outspending” your Free Tier allowance from the Billing Dashboard.
* You can find pricing information online by adding /pricing to the URL of an AWS  service. aws.amazon.com/s3/, for instance, would become aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing.
* The AWS Simple Monthly Calculator and AWS Total Cost of Ownership Calculator let you anticipate real-world usage costs for AWS deployments and (in the case of the TCO calculator) compare your spend with its on-premises equivalent.
* Resource requests will sometimes be refused (and launches will fail) if your request would have pushed your consumption past a service limit.
* The AWS Billing Dashboard is the hub for accessing account administration, payment and tax status management, cost monitoring, and cost control.


###  Exam Essentials

**Understand the value of the 12-month Free Tier**. 
The Free Tier lets you run light services
such as the t2.micro EC2 instance type and a 30 GB SSH EBS volume. The goal is to get
you comfortable with the AWS environment so you can learn how it can be used to host
your applications.

**Understand the value of permanent Free Tier services.** 
Low-volume consumption includes
the retrieval of up to 10 GB of stored objects from Glacier or 62,000 outbound emails
through Amazon SES. The goal is to give you the opportunity to launch proof-of-concept
deployments.

**Know how to access Amazon’s resource pricing online documentation**. 
To accurately calculate the true costs of an AWS deployment, you must understand the pricing for the particular
level of resource you launch within a particular AWS Region. Each service resource
(like an EC2 instance) is billed by metrics unique to its characteristics.

**Use the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator to accurately model multitiered application stack pricing.** 
Pricing for all variations of the core AWS services is prebuilt into the calculator,
allowing you to model pricing for multiple resource configurations.

**Use the AWS Total Cost of Ownership Calculator to compare on-premises with AWS deployment costs.** 
You can conveniently compare apples to apples—capital expenses for
on-premises versus operating expenses for cloud—to know whether the AWS cloud is really
right for your workload.

**Understand how your use of AWS services is limited by default.** 
Access to all service resources is restricted by default limits. In many cases, you can manually request limit
increases from AWS support.

**Understand the value of cost management tools for avoiding costly cloud overspends.**
AWS budgets can be configured to send alerts when your resource consumption approaches or
passes a preset limit. Cost Explorer provides visualizations to more easily monitor historical
and current costs. Cost and usage reports can send in-depth and ongoing CSV-formatted
data to Redshift or QuickSight for analysis. You can use cost allocation tags to more effectively
track and manage the source of account costs. The security and operations of multiple
AWS accounts controlled by a single company can be managed through AWS Organizations.
