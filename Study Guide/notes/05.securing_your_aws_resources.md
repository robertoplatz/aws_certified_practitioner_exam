# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam


## Securing Your AWS Resources


### Introduction

* Everyone in the IT world knows that application and infrastructure security are critically
  important elements of any deployment.
* No matter what role you play within your organization’s cloud deployment life cycle,
  ensuring that your assets are properly protected is part of your job.
* You’ll learn how to use the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to control
  which people and processes get past the wall guarding your resources (authentication) and
  what they’re allowed to do once they’re in (authorization).
* You’ll learn how IAM does that
  through the smart use of users, groups, roles, and federated identities.
* We’ll discuss applying encryption to your cloud data


### AWS Identity and Access Management

* We’ll start with IAM, whose management dashboard (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)
  connects you to all the administration tools you’ll need to manage the basics of account security.
* Security Status section of that page provides a friendly
  reminder that there might be some issues requiring your attention.
* Those suggestions include protecting your account by locking down the root user (the
  user identity that was generated when you first created your AWS account)
* replacing  the effective functionality of root by setting up IAM users and groups for your day-to-day
  administration tasks.

#### Protecting the Root User

* For practical reasons, the root user has the permissions necessary to perform any task on
  your account.
* The problem is that actively using the root user over the long term with only
  minimal protections presents a significant security risk.
* All your data could be stolen or deleted or the attacker could run up hundreds of thousands of
  dollars of charges running a rogue crypto mining operation.
* The recommended best practice is, therefore, to protect the root user by creating a complex
  password and implementing multifactor authentication
* for most administration activities, use IAM users instead.

#### Authentication

* You’ll need to prove you are who you claim to be and that “who you claim to be” has a right to the access you’re
  after, whether you’re logging in to work with your AWS account via the AWS Management
  Console, running a command from the terminal of your personal laptop, or connecting a
  remote application to AWS resources at the programming code level
* Often that will mean providing some kind of user ID and password
* In the case of programmatic or command-line access, you’ll need a set of access keys.
* Opening a remote login session to a Linux instance on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) will require a valid key pair.

#### Authentication
##### Passwords

* The root user logs into the AWS Management Console with the associated email address
  along with the password set when the account was created (or subsequently updated).
* If you want your account to have any chance of surviving an attack, you should avoid passwords that
  can be easily guessed.
* Choose complex and long passwords that include uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols.
* Even better, use only randomly generated
  strings that aren’t even distantly based on the stuff going on in your life (like your birthday).
* And never (ever) reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

#### Authentication
##### Password policy

You can configure a policy from the Account Settings section of the IAM
Dashboard that will require the passwords used by all users on the account to conform
with minimum complexity.

* Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a second layer of security to your logins.
* MFA works by associating a physical device—either a Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)
  or MFA-compliant device like YubiKey or a smartphone with the Authenticator app
  installed—with your account.
* When you try to log in, you’ll fi rst enter a password, and
  then a short-lived code (usually a six-digit number) will be sent to your MFA device.
* You only need to read the number and enter it into the appropriate fi eld on the login page, and
  you’ll be allowed in.

#### Authentication
##### Access Keys

* As we mentioned, programmatic and command-line access to many AWS resources is
  authenticated by access keys (without the option of MFA).
* You can generate a new set of keys while logged into the AWS Management Console from the Security Credentials page
* Choosing the Create New Access Key button will get you there. You’ll then have the
  option of downloading the key to your computer as a text fi le or showing the actual Access Key ID and Secret Access Key values in the dialog where you can copy and paste them
  somewhere safe.
* You should also remember that it’s never a good
  idea to expose the Secret Access Key in plain text—as part of an email, for example.
* The Security Credentials page also lists all your keys and allows you to deactivate, activate,
  or delete existing keys.

#### Authentication
##### Secure Shell Key Pairs

* The industry-standard tool for safely encrypting remote login sessions is the Secure Shell (SSH)
  protocol.
* Without encryption, all commands and keystrokes you enter during a terminal session
  run over an insecure network will be easily readable by anyone with access to that network.
* Encryption converts those plain-text data packets into what looks like gibberish.
* The SSH protocol manages the encryption and decryption steps in the process as
  long as compatible keys are present at both ends of the connection.

When you launch a new EC2 Linux instance , once the private key is downloaded (and, for Linux and macOS, given appropriate
permissions), you open SSH sessions to your instances by invoking the key in a connection
command that might look something like this:

````shell
ssh -i keyname.pem ec2-user@<public_ip_address_of_instance>
````


### Users, Groups, and Roles

* You shouldn’t be using the root user for regular administration
  duties.
* You’re better off creating users to whom you can
  assign only the permissions needed for a specific set of tasks (thus adhering to the principle
  of least privilege) and then having your team authenticate with those user identities.

#### IAM Users

Create an IAM User and Assign Limited Permissions
1. Choose the Users link in the IAM Dashboard, and then choose the Add User button.
2. Give your user a name (we’ll use Steve for this exercise), and select one or both of
   the access types shown. Selecting the Programmatic Access option will guide you to
   create an access key ID and secret access key as part of the process, while the AWS
   Management Console Access option will let you set a login password. For this exercise,
   just select AWS Management Console Access.
3. Choose the Custom Password radio button that will appear, and enter a password
   for your user that meets any password policy requirements you set for your account
   earlier. Leave the Require Password Reset box checked so your user will be forced to
   create a new password when signing in for the first time. Choose the Next: Permissions
   button.
4. On the Set Permissions page, select the Attach Existing Policies Directly tab, and enter
   ec2 into the Filter Policies search field. Scroll down a bit through the results, and choose
   the box next to the AmazonEC2FullAccess entry. This will give your user the authority
   to create, launch, and destroy EC2 instances (for this exercise, we’ll assume that those
   are all the permissions you want to give this user). Choose the Next: Tags button.
5. You don’t need to create a tag for your user, but it can help you keep track of
   things as your account gets busier. So, for this example, enter Unit as the key and
   then EC2-admin as its value. (If you were to add a different user for managing
   Simple Storage Service [S3] resources at some point, you could enter a key-value
   combination of Unit/S3-admin.) Choose Next: Review.
6. When you’ve confirmed that everything is set the way you want, choose Create User.
   You’ll be shown a URL (that looks something like https://291976716973.signin.
   aws.amazon.com/console) that your new user can access to log in with the user
   name (Steve in this example) and the password you’ve created. The number at the
   start of the address portion is your AWS account number. You could also have AWS
   send the new user an email with login instructions.

#### IAM Groups

* As your organization devotes more team members to your AWS infrastructure, manually
  assigning permissions to each individual user one at a time will become a tedious and timeconsuming
  chore.
* Using groups to administrate the permissions associated with multiple
  users in batches can get all that done much more efficiently.
* You could, for instance, have one group called EC2-admins and a second called
  S3-admins.
* When someone new signed up to your team, you would only need to create an
  IAM user and then attach it to the appropriate group.
* The user would automatically inherit
  all the permissions of that group.
* And if at some time down the line you needed to add to
  or reduce the group’s permissions, editing the group itself would instantly apply the changes
  to all the group’s members.

#### IAM Roles

* Like users and groups, IAM roles define the limits for what can be done within your AWS
  account.
* The important difference is that, unlike users and groups, roles are, for the most
  part, used by applications and services rather than people.
* When creating a role, you begin by defining a trusted entity—the entity (or beneficiary)
  that will be trusted to use the role.
* That entity could be an AWS service (like EC2),
  an identity provided by a third-party federated identify provider (like Google or Amazon
  Cognito—which allow a digital identity to be linked across multiple identity management
  systems), or a different AWS account.
* You’ll have to specify exactly what permissions you want to give the role or, in other
  words, what you want the beneficiary processes to be able to do.
* You’ll then choose the
  policy that best fits your anticipated needs and associate it with the role.


#### Providing Federated Access

* Federation expands the available tools for managing authentication beyond the simple IAM options you’ve
already seen.
* You can integrate third-party standards like the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0
  (SAML) or Microsoft’s Active Directory into your infrastructure.
* This lets you use users’
  existing login sessions to add single sign-on (SSO) across your AWS infrastructure and
  enable seamless access between your mobile apps and backend resources like DynamoDB
  databases or S3-based objects.
* federated access to AWS resources can be handled through the AWS Single Sign-On service.
* For Active Directory integration with cloud-based MS SharePoint, .NET, and SQL Server–
  based workloads, you would use the AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory
  (more commonly known as AWS Microsoft AD).


#### Credential Report

* There’s one more IAM resource you should know about: credential reports.
* Accessed from  the IAM Dashboard, a credential report displays a simple interface with no more (or less)
  than one lonely button: Download Report.
* Reports contain important information about the
  state of your account security, listing all current IAM users and giving you key intelligence,
  such as when each of them last logged in, whether they have MFA enabled, whether they
  have active access keys, and when those keys were last rotated.
* This is a quick and (fairly) painless way to monitor your account for security holes that
  you shouldn’t ignore.


### Encryption

* You should consider encrypting your data just about wherever you
  store or consume it.
* Whether or not your particular use cases and privacy needs justify the
  effort, AWS provides a number of enterprise-strength encryption tools that are conveniently
  and effectively integrated into relevant services.
* Encryption keys—the data files used to control an object’s cryptographic
  transformation—are mostly managed on AWS by the AWS Key Management Service
  (KMS).
* When you select to encrypt an AWS resource, KMS will apply encryption using
  a customer master key (CMK) that’s been generated especially for your account.
* You can
  manage your keys—including creating new keys or scheduling the deletion of old ones—
  through either the KMS Dashboard or the Encryption Keys page within IAM.
* You can encrypt any data managed by an AWS service, including
  Relational Database Service (RDS) and DynamoDB databases.
* Elastic Block Store (EBS)
  volumes that you attach to EC2 instances can also be encrypted when you create them.
* AWS will invisibly decrypt your data only when the access
  request is accompanied by successful authentication.
* You can have S3
  encrypt the objects of a bucket at any time—during or after bucket creation.
* You can select
  either S3-managed server-side encryption keys (SSE-S3) or KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS).
* But besides ensuring that the wrong people won’t be able to read the objects living in
  your S3 buckets (server-side encryption), you also have to worry about the bad guys intercepting
  those objects while in transit from your local infrastructure (client-side encryption).
* Client-side encryption is a bit more complicated. You’ll need to encrypt your data
  before uploading it to S3 using either a KMS-managed customer master key or a clientside
  master key.
* That key will then be used to manage the encryption and decryption
  throughout the data’s life cycle on the S3 platform.

### Regulatory Compliance (AWS Artifact)

* AWS Artifact is the service home page is a set of links to documents describing various regulatory standards and how
  AWS meets them.
* Each of those documents is referred to by Amazon as an artifact.
* There are national documents like the U.S. government’s Federal
  Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), the Government of Canada
  (GC) Partner Package, and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)
  “Management of Security Risk in Information and Information Technology” workbook.
* You’ll also find industry standards like the PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC) and
  Responsibility Summary for handling credit card transaction data.
* You’ll also find official reports of Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1, 2, and 3
  audits of AWS infrastructure.



### Summary

* You should enforce the use of strong passwords by your users by creating a password policy
  in IAM.
* Ideally, you should also require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Programmatic and command-line access to resources is authenticated using security
  credentials consisting of an access key ID and a secret access key.
* SSH access to EC2 Linux
  instances must be authenticated using a key pair generated by AWS—the private key must
  be installed on the client (user) computer.
* You can efficiently control resource access for large numbers of users with different
  access needs through IAM groups.
* The principle of least privilege supports giving your
  users and groups only the minimum permissions they’ll need to do their jobs.
* An IAM role is a set of permissions permitting access to a beneficiary process to a
  defined set of resources.
* This is an important tool for securely enabling functionality
  between parts of your AWS infrastructure.
* You can review important information on the security status of your users from the credential
  report in IAM and read about AWS compliance with regulatory and industry standards
  in AWS Artifact.

### Exam Essentials

**Know how to lock down your account’s root user to reduce your exposure to risk.**
Make sure your root user has a strong password that is MFA-enabled and is never used for
day-to-day administration tasks.


**Know how to enforce the use of strong passwords for all your users.**
Set an IAM password policy to force longer passwords using uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and nonstandard
characters.


**Understand how AWS manages access credentials for EC2 key pairs, secret access keys,
and encryption keys.** 
Whether you’re looking to secure terminal connections to your EC2
servers, API access, or the privacy of your data, you’ll need to make use of AWS encryption
services of one sort or another.

**Know how to provide (federated) access to your AWS resources based on third-party
authentication systems like Google.**
Using standards such as SAML 2.0 and Microsoft’s
Active Directory, you can incorporate external authentication into your AWS infrastructure,
making it easy, for instance, for users of your mobile application to retrieve data from
a DynamoDB database.

**Be aware that AWS Key Management Service (KMS) manages encryption keys.**
KMS-managed keys are used across a wide range of AWS services, including EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, and S3.
Be aware that AWS Artifact is a compliance information resource. AWS Artifact provides
access to official documentation on the compliance of AWS infrastructure relating to any
one of dozens of government or industry security standards.
