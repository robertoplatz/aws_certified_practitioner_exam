# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

## The Cloud

### Introduction


You’ll need to figure out just what the cloud is, what technologies it’s built on, what kinds of cost savings and operational advantages it can bring you, and how cloud-based applications work differently than their traditional cousins.


### What Is Cloud Computing?

* there’s no significant difference between running a software application on servers hosted in your own office versus locating it within Amazon’s infrastructure.
* you need to make sure you’ve got sufficient compute, memory, network, and storage resources.
* fast deployments and avoiding over-provisioning are key goals.
* when it comes to the largest cloud providers, there are important differences.
* It can offer you service, cost, and reliability performance that you could probably never hope to re-create on your own. The DevOps team at an IT company is moving 500 GB of data from an EC2 instance to an S3 bucket in the same region. Which of the following scenario captures the correct charges for this data transfer?



#### Cloud Computing features

* Highly Available and Scalable Resources
* Professionally Secured Infrastructure
* Metered Payment Model

#### Highly Available and Scalable Resources

* Design multiple layers of redundancy so that whenever one component fails, its workload is automatically and instantly moved to a healthy replacement.
* Connect resources in geographically remote locations so that the failure of one complete region could trigger a predefined relocation. This relocation can be supported by a similarly automated rerouting of network requests.
* Provide customers with access to as much compute power as they could possibly need, and deliver that power on-demand.
* Because of the scale and efficiency of the platform, AWS can do all that at a price that’s often far below what it would cost to run comparable workloads locally.

#### Professionally Secured Infrastructure

* As a business, you’re already responsible for protecting the workstations and networking hardware running in your office along with securing your organization’s data and code your developers put into your apps.
* The integrity of your underlying server infrastructure is just one more potential area of vulnerability for you to worry about.
* AWS is so good at what it does—and because it takes responsibility for the security of its platform’s underlying networking and compute infrastructure—this is one area where outsourcing will usually make sense.
* the terms of the AWS Shared Responsibility Model mean that, in many cases, the security and integrity of the resources you run on the cloud are still your problem.

#### Metered Payment Model

* One of the defining characteristics of any public cloud computing platform is the way it automatically allocates resources to meet client requests.
* In the cloud, by contrast, you fire up an instance, run it for the length of time your test requires, and then shut it down. You’ll be billed for only that testing time, which, in some cases, could cost you a fraction of a penny.
* there’s no human processing involved in cloud compute billing
* This metered payment makes it possible to consider entirely new ways of testing and delivering your applications, and it often means your cost-cycle expenses will be considerably lower than they would if you were using physical servers running on-premises.
* On-premises  infrastructure tends to be very capex-heavy since you need to purchase loads of expensive hardware up front.
* Cloud operations, on the other hand, involve virtually no capex costs at all, operating expenses (opex).
* your costs are ongoing, consisting mostly of per-hour resource “rental” fees.

### Server Virtualization: The Basics

* When you request a virtual machine (VM) with a particular processor speed, memory capacity, and storage size, AWS doesn’t send some poor engineer running through the halls of its data center looking for an available machine with exactly that profile.
* AWS carves the necessary resources from larger existing devices.

* A 5 TB storage drive could, for instance, be divided into dozens of smaller virtual volumes, each associated with a different virtual server (or instance).
* The resources of a single physical server could be invisibly shared between multiple instances.



#### Virtualization Model

The virtualization model offers two compelling benefits:

* Speed: Defining, purchasing, provisioning, testing, and launching a new physical server can take months. Even a simple reboot can keep you waiting for a couple of minutes.
* Efficiency: It’s rare to find a nonvirtualized physical server that utilizes anywhere near 100 percent of its capacity. More likely, either it’ll spend its time running mostly empty or it’ll be badly overused while you wait for more capacity to come online.

Amazon’s formidable scale and logistical abilities mean that it’s often able to leverage the benefits of virtualization to provide both superior performance and pricing.

### Cloud Platform Models

Cloud services come in more than one flavor. Choosing the one that’s right for your project will depend on your specific needs and how much fine control you’ll need over the underlying gears and levers.

* Infrastructure as a Service
* Platform as a Service
* Software as a Service
* Serverless Workloads

#### Infrastructure as a Service

* IaaS products give you direct access to a provider’s compute, storage, and networking assets.
* it’s you that’s in there playing around at the hardware level, you—rather than the IaaS provider—are responsible for the consequences of any bad configurations.

AWS IaaS products include:
* Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) for virtual machine instances,
* Elastic Block Store(EBS) for storage volumes, 
* and Elastic Load Balancing.

#### Platform as a Service

* Platform as a Service (PaaS) products simplify the process of building an application by hiding the complexity of the infrastructure that runs it.
* ou’re given an interface through which you define the behavior and environment you want for your application.

AWS PaaS products include:
* Elastic Beanstalk
* Elastic Container Service (ECS)

#### Software as a Service

Software as a Service (SaaS) products offer services meant to be accessed by end users. An easily recognizable illustration is Google’s Gmail service.

* Simple Email Service and Amazon WorkSpaces.


#### Responsability across multiple infrastructure types

Figure 1.2 compares the scope of responsibility you have on IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS platforms with the way it works for on-premises deployments.

#### Serverless Workloads

* Besides doing an excellent job emulating traditional server behavior,
* cloud providers can also enable entirely new ways to administrate applications and data.

* What “serverless” does allow is for individual developers to run their code for seconds or minutes at a time on some else’s cloud servers.
* AWS Lambda—makes it possible to design code that reacts to external events.

Example of a video file is uploaded to a repository (S3 bucket), it can trigger a Lambda function that will convert the file in a new format.



* There’s no need to maintain and pay for an actual instance running 24/7
And there’s no administration overhead to worry about.


### Scalability and Elasticity

#### Scalability

* A scalable service will automatically grow in capacity to seamlessly meet any changes in demand;
* The response might include automatically launching new server instances to add extra compute power to your existing cluster;
* A large cloud provider like AWS will, for all practical purposes, have endless available capacity;
* The only practical limit to the maximum size of your application is your organization’s budget;

#### Elasticity

* The reason the word elastic is used in the names of so many AWS services (Elastic Compute Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Elastic Beanstalk, and so on) is because those services are built to be easily and automatically resized.
* Generally, you set the maximum and minimum performance levels you want for your application, and the AWS service(s) you’re using will automatically add or remove resources to meet changing usage demands.


### Summary

* While AWS customers are still responsible for the applications they run in the cloud, they don’t need to worry about the underlying physical infrastructure that’s managed by AWS.
* Much of the attraction of cloud computing is the ability to pay for only the services you use, and only as you use them.
* Server virtualization makes it possible to more densely pack software operations on physical hardware, potentially driving down the costs and improving the time-todeployment  of compute workloads.
* An even more “virtualized” kind of virtualization is serverless computing, where customers are aware their code and the network events that trigger it.
* Cloud-optimized workloads are designed to take advantage of the scalability and elasticity of cloud platforms.

### Exam Essentials

* The sheer scale and geographic redundancy of the physical compute and networking resources owned by AWS mean that the company is able to guarantee a level of reliability and availability that would be hard to reproduce in any other environment.
* Understand how metered, pay-per-use pricing makes for flexible compute options.
* Understand that cloud services come on a wide range of forms.
* IaaS gives you near-full control over virtualized hardware resources, closely emulating the way you would administrate actual physical servers.
* PaaS products abstract the underlying infrastructure, providing a simplified interface for you to add your application code.
* SaaS products provide services over a public network directly to end users.
* Understand how serverless computing can be both cheap and efficient.
* Serverless services

### Exam Essentials

* like AWS Lambda allow you access to AWS compute power for up to 15 minutes for a single function.
* This lets you operate code in response to real-time event triggers.
* Understand how scalability allows applications to grow to meet need.
* A cloud-optimized application allows for automated provisioning of server instances that are designed from
  scratch to perform a needed compute function within an appropriate network environment.
* Understand how elasticity matches compute power to both rising and falling demand.
* The scaling services of a cloud provider—like AWS Auto Scaling—should be configured to force compliance with your budget and application needs.
* You set the upper and lower limits, and the scaler handles the startups and shutdowns to optimize operations in between those limits.
