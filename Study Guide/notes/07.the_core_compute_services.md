# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

## The Core Compute Services

### Introduction

* While Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) wasn’t quite the first service announced by AWS,
  once it did show up in 2006, it became the obvious cornerstone tool for many cloud
  deployments.
* EC2 faithfully mirrors the functionality of traditional on-premises data
  centers: you provision and launch virtual servers (known as instances) to run the same
  kinds of application workloads that would once have kept legacy servers busy.
* The fact that
  EC2 instances are more resilient and scalable and, often, cheaper than their on-premises
  cousins was just a happy bonus.
* you’ll learn about how it all happens using EC2 and its more lightweight
  counterparts like Elastic Beanstalk, Lightsail, Docker (including via the Kubernetes
  orchestrator), and Lambda.

### Deploying Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Servers

* To get your virtual machine (VM) instance running, you’ll first define the elements one
  at a time.
* You’ll select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), rather than installing an operating system and a software stack from scratch
  the traditional way;
* Instead of choosing the right CPU, memory modules, and network adapters and adding them to your physical
  motherboard, you’ll choose the instance type matching your application needs.
* you’ll define virtual storage volumes available through the Elastic Block Store (EBS).

#### Amazon Machine Images

* An image is a software bundle that was built from a template definition and made available
  within a single AWS Region.
* The bundle can be copied to a freshly created storage volume that, once the image is extracted, will become a bootable drive that’ll turn the VM it’s
  attached to into a fully operational server.
* You can select AMIs that will give you clean, cloud-optimized operating systems like official versions of
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Ubuntu, Windows Server, or Amazon’s own Amazon
  Linux.
* But you can also find the OS you need preloaded with one of hundreds of popular
  software stacks like OpenVPN (secure remote connectivity), TensorFlow (neural networks),
  or a Juniper firewall already installed and ready to go.

AMIs are organized into four collections: 
* the Quick Start set, 
* any custom AMIs you might have created, 
* the AWS Marketplace,
* and Community AMIs.

#### Using Quick Start AMIs

* AWS makes the three dozen or so most popular AMIs easily available through the Quick
  Start tab on the Choose An Amazon Machine Image page
* For the most part, they’re Free Tier–eligible. This means that launching them on a lightweight instance type within
  an account’s first year will incur no costs.
* The available Linux distributions you’ll find here are mostly categorized as long-term
  support (LTS) releases, meaning that they’ll be eligible for security and functional updates
  for at least five years from their original release date.
* Even outside of the Free Tier, the use of the open source operating systems like Ubuntu
  and CentOS will always be free.
* But other choices—like Windows Server and RHEL—will carry the normal licensing charges.
* Once you launch an instance running one of those
  images, the charges will be billed through your AWS account.
* Besides the general-purpose OS choices available through Quick Start, you can also find
  images optimized for deep learning, container hosting, .NET Core, and Microsoft SQL
  Server.


#### Using AWS Marketplace and Community AMIs

* AWS Marketplace is a software store managed by Amazon where vendors make their
  products available to AWS customers as ready-to-run AMIs;
* Companies like SAP, Oracle, and NVIDIA will package their software solutions into AMIs, often running on one or another
  Linux distribution;
* When you select a Marketplace AMI, you’ll be shown its total billing cost, broken down
  into separate software license and EC2 infrastructure amounts.
* Marketplace AMIs will often offer a limited-time free trial for their software and
  reduced annual subscription rates.
* You can also view and search through Marketplace
  offerings outside of the EC2 Launch Instance interface through the Marketplace site:
  https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace.
* There are more than 100,000 AMIs to choose from in the Community AMIs tab.
* Some are supported by recognized vendors such as
  Canonical, but others are provided as is, often by end users like you.
* Given the informal  sources of some Community AMIs, you must take responsibility for the security and
  reliability of AMIs you launch.

#### Creating Your Own AMIs

* It’s possible to convert any EC2 instance into an AMI by creating a snapshot from the EBS
  volume used with an instance and then creating an image from the snapshot.
* The resulting
  image will be available as an AMI either in the AMIs menu on the EC2 Dashboard or on the
  My AMIs tab in the Choose An Amazon Machine Image page of the instance launch process;

Why build your own AMIs?

* Suppose you’ve spent a full week carefully configuring an instance
  as your company’s application server.
* You did such a good job that you’d now like
  to be able to deploy exact copies of the instance to meet growing demand for your application.
* One way to make that both possible and painless is to create an AMI from your
  instance and select the AMI whenever another instance is needed.

### Understanding EC2 Instance Types

* An EC2 instance type is simply a description of the kind of hardware resources your instance
  will be using.
* The t2.micro instance type, for instance, comes with 1 GB of memory, low-to-moderate data transfer rates 
  to network connections, and one virtual CPU (vCPU) running on a 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon processor.
* A c5d.18xlarge instance type, on the other hand, gives you 72 vCPUs on a 3 GHz Intel Xeon Platinum 8124M processor, and 144 GB of memory.
* A vCPU, by the way, is an arbitrary—and somewhat mysterious—metric used by AWS to describe the compute power you’ll get from a given instance.
* It’s notoriously difficult to accurately map the value of a single vCPU against any one real-world device.


EC2 offers instance type families that are optimized for very different computing tasks.

* The T2, T3, and M5 types are included in the general-purpose family because of their ability to perform well for a wide range of
  uses.
* Besides general-purpose, EC2 also offers compute-optimized, memory-optimized,
  accelerated-computing, and storage-optimized families of instance types.
* The most up-to-date list will always be available here: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types.

#### EC2 Instance Types

![img.png](https://github.com/robertoplatz/aws_certified_practitioner_exam/blob/main/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practitioner%20Study%20Guide/notes/images/instance_types.png?raw=true)

* The bottom line is that choosing the right instance type family will sometimes let you
  get away with fewer vCPUs and less memory—and a lower cost.
* If regulatory restrictions or company policy requires you to use only physically isolated
  instances, you can request either a dedicated instance or a dedicated host.
* A dedicated instance is a regular EC2 instance that, instead of sharing a physical host
  with other AWS customers, runs on an isolated host that’s set aside exclusively for your
  account.
* A dedicated host also gives you instance isolation but, in addition, allows a higher
  level of control over how your instances will be placed and run within the host environment.
* Dedicated hosts can also simplify and reduce the costs of running licensed software.
* Both levels involve extra per-hour pricing and are available using on-demand, reserved, or
  spot models;

### Server Storage: Elastic Block Store and Instance Store Volumes

* Like everything else in the cloud, the storage volumes holding your instance’s OS and data are
  going to be virtual.
* that’ll mean the 20 or 30 (or 2,000) GB drive holding your
  application is really just a 20 or 30 GB partition cleverly disguised to look like a stand-alone
  device.
* Some instance types support only volumes from the Elastic Block Store (EBS), others get
  their storage from instance store volumes, and some can happily handle both.

#### Amazon Elastic Block Store

* The physical drive where an EBS volume actually exists may live quite a distance from
  the physical server that’s giving your instance life.
* EBS volumes speak with your instance over a super low-latency network connection
  spanning the data center, rather than connecting directly to hte mother board via SATA Cable.
* As fast as the EBS-EC2 responses are, they’re still not quite as good as the experience
  you’ll get from EC2 instance store volumes.

what does EBS offer to compensate?

* Unlike the instance store that’s ephemeral, the data stored on EBS volumes will survive
  shutdowns and system crashes. That can be a factor for workloads where data persistence
  is necessary.
* EBS volumes can be encrypted, which, when you’re working with sensitive data, can
  make a big difference.
* EBS volumes can be moved around, mounted on other instances, and, as you’ve seen,
  converted to AMIs.

#### Amazon EC2 Instance Store Volumes

* Unlike EBS, those instance types compatible with instance store volumes can enjoy the
  benefits of having their data on physical drives attached directly to the physical instance server.
* The downsides of instance store volumes (ephemeral data, no encryption, and
  lack of flexibility) are offset by faster data reads and writes.
* This can be useful for processing and analyzing fast-moving data streams where the data itself doesn’t need to be
  persistent.


### Understanding EC2 Pricing Models

#### On-Demand Instances

* The most expensive pricing tier is on-demand, where you pay for every hour the instance
  is running regardless of whether you’re actually using it.
* On-demand is great for workloads that need to run for a limited time without interruption.
* You could, for instance, schedule an on-demand instance in anticipation of increased
  requests against your application—perhaps your ecommerce site is offering a one-day, 50%
  off sale.
* But running an on-demand instance 24/7 for months at a time when you need it
  for only a couple of hours a day is going to cost you far more than it’s worth.
* Instead, for such cases you should consider an alternative pricing model.

#### Reserved Instances

* If your application needs to run uninterrupted for more than a month at a time, then you’ll
  usually be better off purchasing a reserved instance.
* You’re unlikely to find an available reservation with a term shorter than 12 months. One- and three-year
  terms are always available.
* You’re paying AWS—or other AWS customers who are
  selling reservations they’re no longer using—for the right to run an EC2 instance at a specified
  cost during the reservation term.
* Reserved instances are paid for using an All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront
  payment option.
* Predictably, the more you pay up front, the less it’ll cost you overall.

#### Spot Instances


* For workloads that don’t need to run constantly and can survive unexpected shutdowns,
  your cheapest option will probably involve requesting instances on the EC2 spot market.
* AWS makes unused compute capacity available at steep discounts—as much as 90% off the
  on-demand cost.
* The catch is that the capacity can, on two minutes’ notice, be reclaimed
  by shutting down your instance.
* This wouldn’t be an option for many typical use cases that require persistence and predictability.
* But it can be perfect for certain classes of containerized big data workloads or
  test and development environments.
* Spot deployments can also be automated by defining your capacity and pricing needs as
  part of a spot fleet.
* The use of spot instances can, in addition, be incorporated into sophisticated,
  multitier operations that are deeply integrated with other automation and deployment
  orchestration tools.
* The https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot page provides helpful background and links.


### Simplified Deployments Through Managed Services


* AWS services will handle much of the underlying
  infrastructure for you, allowing you to focus on your application needs.
* The benefits of  a managed service are sometimes offset by premium pricing.
* One important example of such a managed service is the Relational Database Service
  (RDS).
* RDS lets you set the basic configuration parameters for the database engine of your choice, gives you an endpoint
  address through which your applications can connect to the database, and takes care of all
  the details invisibly.
* Besides being responsible for making top-level configuration decisions,
  you won’t need to worry about maintaining the database instance hosting the database,
  software updates, or data replication.
* One step beyond a managed service—which handles only one part of your deployment
  stack for you—is a managed deployment, where the whole stack is taken care of behind the
  scenes.
* All you’ll need to make things work with one of these services is your application
  code or, if it’s a website you’re after, your content.
* Two AWS services created with managed deployments in mind are Amazon Lightsail
  and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

#### Amazon Lightsail 

* Lightsail is promoted as a low-stress way to enter the Amazon cloud world.
* It offers blueprints that, when launched, will automatically provision all the compute, storage,
  database, and network resources needed to make your deployment work.
*You set the  pricing level you’re after (currently that’ll cost you somewhere between $3.50 and $160
  USD each month) 
* add an optional script that will be run on your instance at startup,
  and AWS will take over. 
* For context, $3.50 will get you 512 MB of memory, 1 vCPU, a
  20 GB solid-state drive (SSD) storage volume, and 1 TB of transfers.
* Lightsail uses all the same tools—such as the AMIs and instances you saw earlier in the
  chapter—to convert your plans to reality.
* Because things are packaged in blueprints, you won’t have the unlimited range of tools
  for your deployments that you’d get from EC2 itself.


* Operating systems: Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, OpenSUSE, and
Windows Server
* Applications: WordPress, Magento, Drupal, Joomla, Redmine, and Plesk
* Stacks: Node.js, GitLab, LAMP, MEAN, and Nginx

In case you’re curious, a LAMP stack is a web server built on Linux,
Apache, MySQL (or MariaDB), and PHP (or Python). By contrast, MEAN is a
JavaScript stack for dynamic websites consisting of MongoDB, Express.js,
AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js.


#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

* If anything, Elastic Beanstalk is even simpler than Lightsail. All that’s expected from you
  is to define the application platform and then upload your code.
* You can choose between preconfigured environments (including Go, .NET, Java Node.js, and PHP) and a
  number of Docker container environments.
* The “code” for Docker applications is defined
  with specially formatted Dockerrun.aws.json files.
* One key difference between the two services is that while Lightsail bills at a fl at rate
  (between $3.50 and $160 per month, as you saw), Beanstalk generates costs according to
  how resources are consumed.
* You don’t get to choose how many vCPUs or how much
  memory you will use.
* Instead, your application will scale its resource consumption according to demand.
* AWS will invisibly ramp up the infrastructure to meet demand as it increase volume access to the service.
* As demand falls, your infrastructure will similarly drop.
* Keep this in mind, as such variations in demand will determine how much you’ll be billed each month.


### Deploying Container and Serverless Workloads

* Even virtualized servers like EC2 instances tend to be resource-hungry.
* They do, after all, act like discrete, stand-alone machines running on top of a full-stack operating system.
* Each virtual server requires its own OS Kernel and device driver, occurring some serious duplications.


#### Containers

* Container technologies such as Docker avoid a lot of that overhead by allowing individual
  containers to share the Linux kernel with the physical host.
* They’re also able to share common
  elements (called layers) with other containers running on a single host.
* This makes Docker containers fast to load and execute and also lets you pack many more container
  workloads on a single hardware platform.
* You’re always free to fire up one or more EC2 instances, install Docker, and use them
  to run as many containers as you’d like.
* But keeping all the bits and pieces talking to each
  other can get complicated.
* Instead, you can use either Amazon Elastic Container Service
  (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) to orchestrate swarms of
  Docker containers on AWS using EC2 resources.
* Both of those services manage the underlying
  infrastructure for you, allowing you to ignore the messy details and concentrate on
  administrating Docker itself.
* The difference between ECS and EKS is that EKS gets there by using the popular open source Kubernetes orchestration
  tool. They are different paths to the same place.


#### Serverless Functions

* The serverless computing model uses a resource footprint that’s even smaller than the one
  left by containers.
* Not only do serverless functions not require their own OS kernel, but
  they tend to spring into existence, perform some task, and then just as quickly die within
  minutes, if not seconds.
* On the surface, Amazon’s serverless service—AWS Lambda—looks a bit like Elastic
  Beanstalk.
* You define your function by setting a runtime environment (like Node.js, .NET,
  or Python) and uploading the code you want the function to run.
* But, unlike Beanstalk, Lambda functions run only when triggered by a preset event.
* It could be a call from your
  mobile application, a change to a separate AWS resources (like an S3 bucket), or a logbased
  alert.
* If an hour or a week passes without a trigger, Lambda won’t launch a function (and you
  won’t be billed anything).
* If there are a thousand concurrent executions, Lambda will scale
  automatically to meet the demand.
* Lambda functions are short-lived: they’ll time out after
  15 minutes.

### Summary

Configuring EC2 instances is designed to mirror the process of provisioning and launching
on-premises servers. Instances are defined by your choice of AMIs, instance type, storage
volumes, and pricing model.

AMIs are organized into four categories: Quick Start, custom (My AMIs), AWS
Marketplace, and Community. You can create your own AMI from a snapshot based on
the EBS volume of an EC2 instance.

EC2 instance types are designed to fit specific application demands, and individual optimizations
are generally available in varying sizes.

EBS storage volumes can be encrypted and are more like physical hard drives in the flexibility
of their usage. Instance store volumes are located on the same physical server hosting
your instance and will, therefore, deliver faster performance.

EC2 on-demand pricing is best for short-term workloads that can’t be interrupted.
Longer-term workloads—like ecommerce websites—will often be much less expensive
when purchased as reserved instances. Spot instances work well for compute-intensive data
operations that can survive unexpected shutdowns.

Lightsail, Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Container Service, Elastic Container Service for
Kubernetes, and Lambda are all designed to provide abstracted compute services that
simplify,automate, and reduce the cost of compute operations.

#### Exam Essentials


**Understand the elements required to provision an EC2 instance.**
An instance requires a base OS (AMI) and—optionally—an application stack, an instance type for its hardware
profile, and either an EBS or an instance volume for storage.

**Understand the sources, pricing, and availability of EC2 AMIs.** 
The Quick Start and Marketplace AMIs are supported by Amazon or a recognized third-party vendor, which
may not be true of AMIs selected from the Community collection. In any case, you should
confirm whether using a particular AMI will incur extra charges beyond the normal EC2
usage.

**Understand how EC2 instance types determine the compute power of your instance.** 
Instance types are divided into type families, each of which focuses on a functional niche (general
purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, accelerated computing, and storage
optimized). Your application needs and budget will determine which instance type you choose.
**Understand the differences between EBS and instance store volumes. EBS volumes are
versatile (they can, for instance, be converted into AMIs) and will survive an instance shutdown.
Instance store volumes, on the other hand, provide faster reads and writes and can
be more secure for some purposes. Which storage you use will often depend on the instance
type you choose.

**Understand the differences between EC2 pricing models.** 
On-demand is the most expensive way to consume EC2 instances, but it’s also flexible and reliable (you control when an
instance starts or stops). Reserved instances work well for instances that must remain running
for longer periods of time. Spot instances are the least expensive but can be shut down
with only a two-minute warning.

Be familiar with Amazon’s managed deployment services. Amazon Lightsail provides
blueprints for simplified flat-rate deployments using EC2 resources under the hood.
Lightsail deployments can, if needed, be transferred to regular EC2 infrastructure without
service interruption. Elastic Beanstalk manages the underlying infrastructure for your
application and automatically scales according to demand.

**Understand how container and serverless models work in the cloud.**
Containers—like Docker—share the OS kernel and device drivers with their host and share common software
layers with each other to produce fast and lightweight applications. ECS and EKS
are AWS services focused on simplifying Docker orchestration within the EC2 framework.
Lambda functions are designed to respond to event triggers to launch short-lived
operations.
