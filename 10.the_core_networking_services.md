## The Core Networking Services

In this chapter, you’ll learn about the following three core networking
services AWS offers:

* Virtual Private Cloud
* Route 53
* CloudFront


## Virtual Private Cloud

* The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service provides the network backbone for many
  AWS services.
* A virtual private cloud is a virtual network in the AWS cloud that’s logically
  isolated from other networks.
* The most well-known use of VPCs is connecting EC2
  instances together and to other AWS services and networks, including the internet.
* You can create your own nondefault VPCs. Nondefault VPCs are fully isolated from
  every other network and AWS resource, including other VPCs.

### VPC CIDR Blocks

* Each VPC requires a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block to define the range of
  IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses that resources within the VPC can use.
* Default VPCs have a
  CIDR of 172.31.0.0/16, which includes all addresses from 172.31.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.
* You must choose a CIDR size between /16 and /28,but otherwise, any CIDR you could assign to a traditional network can also be assigned
  to a VPC.
* The smaller the CIDR size, the greater the number of IP addresses available
  to the VPC.
* At your request, AWS can also assign an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC. The IPv6 CIDR
  will be a global unicast IPv6 address with a size of /56.

### Subnets

* Each VPC requires further division into one or more subnets. 
* A subnet provides logical separation and isolation of resources within the same VPC.
* For example, you may want to have web servers and application servers in the same VPC, but you want only the web servers
  to be accessible from the internet.
* As with a VPC, you must defi ne a CIDR for each subnet. The subnet CIDR must be a
  subset of the VPC CIDR, with a size between /16 and /28.
* Each subnet exists only within a single Availability Zone. Refer to Figure 10.1 for a sample VPC topology with
  two subnets.
* This is why within each default VPC,
  Amazon creates a default subnet in each Availability Zone. This way, you can launch EC2
  instances without ever having to configure a VPC.

### Internet Access

* An internet gateway is a VPC resource that allows EC2 instances to obtain a public IP
  address and access the internet.
* For instances in a subnet to have internet access, that subnet must contain a default
  route to the internet gateway that’s attached to the VPC.
* A subnet with a default route to an internet gateway is called a `public subnet`.
* you can allocate an elastic IP address and then assign it to an instance.
  Elastic IP addresses can be reassigned to different instances and don’t change until you
  deallocate them.

### Security Groups

* A security group is a firewall that determines what network traffic can pass into and out of
  an instance. 
* Each instance must have least one security group attached.
* Security groups consist of inbound and outbound rules that permit network traffic
  according to IP address and protocol.
* Inbound rules control what IP addresses can send
  traffic to the instance, whereas outbound rules control what IP addresses an instance may
  send traffic to.
* if you want anyone to be able to
  reach a web server in a public subnet, you would need to create an inbound rule to allow
  HTTP traffic from any IP address.
* By default, security groups don’t contain inbound rules.
* Each security group by default contains an outbound rule that allows access to any
  IP address.
* Every VPC, not just the default VPC, contains a default security group that you can
  modify to meet your needs.

### Network Access Control Lists

* A network access control list (NACL) is a firewall that operates at the subnet level.
* A NACL consists of inbound and outbound rules that, by default, allow all traffic.
* A NACL can’t restrict traffic between instances in the same subnet, but it can prevent traffic from
  entering or leaving a subnet.
* Each VPC has a default NACL that can be associated with one
  or more subnets.

### VPC Peering

* A VPC peering connection is a private, point-to-point connection between only two VPCs.
* VPC peering allows resources in different VPCs to communicate with each other over the
  private AWS network instead of the internet.
* VPC peering connection allows instances in
  one VPC to access certain types of resources in another VPC, such as another instance or a
  network load balancer.
* There’s also no need for VPC resources to have internet access in order to use VPC peering.
* Peered VPCs can be in the
  same region or in different regions.

### Virtual Private Networks

* A virtual private network (VPN) allows you to connect a VPC to an external network,
  such as a data center or office, via a secure connection that traverses the public internet.
* To set up a VPN connection, you create a virtual private gateway and attach it to a VPC.
* AWS has tested a variety of customer
  gateways from different manufacturers including Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks, and
  Check Point.
* VPN connections are encrypted using AES 128- or 256-bit encryption. 
* IP routing can be configured statically, or you can use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to share
  routes between your VPC and external network. 
* A single VPC can have up to 10 VPN connections.

### Direct Connect

* Direct Connect provides private network connectivity to your VPC and public services such
  as Amazon S3 and Glacier.
* There’s no need to have a separate internet circuit just to access
  these services.
* Keep in mind that Direct Connect doesn’t provide internet access, so if you need
  it, you’ll still need a separate internet connection.
* Direct Connect links are offered through AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. Direct
  Connect operates using a dedicated link that operates at 1 or 10 Gbps.
* If you need fast, consistent connectivity to AWS, Direct Connect is a good option versus connecting
  via the internet. It is, however, more expensive.
* If you need less than 1 Gbps of bandwidth, you can obtain a hosted Direct Connect
  connection from an APN partner. A hosted connection comes in speeds of 50 Mbps,
  100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 400 Mbps, and 500 Mbps.


## Route 53

* Route 53 is Amazon’s global Domain Name System (DNS) service.
* This process of translating a domain name to an IP address is called name resolution.

### Resource Records

* Name resolution goes beyond just mapping domain names to IP addresses.
* DNS can store mappings for different types of data, including IPv6 addresses, mail servers, and even arbitrary
  text.
* For DNS to work, someone must first define some resource records for a domain. A
  resource record consists of several fields, but the most important are the name, type, and
  value.

### Domain Name Registration

* A public domain name is one that anyone on the internet can resolve.
* When you register a domain name, you must
  do so under a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com, .net, or .org.
* Registering a domain gives you control of it for the duration of the lease, which can be
  in yearly increments between 1 year and 10 years. Regardless of how long you initially
  register a domain for, you can renew it in yearly increments indefinitely.
* If you have an existing domain name with another registrar, you can transfer it to Route 53. Transferring
  a domain entails extending the registration by at least one year.
* Registering a domain name gives you control over it for the duration
  of the lease, including the right to specify the service you want to provide DNS hosting
  for the domain.
* This means the domain registrar and DNS hosting provider don’t have to
  be the same company, but they often are. Route 53 is both a registrar and a DNS hosting
  provider.

### Hosted Zones

* To have Route 53 host the DNS for a public domain name, you create a public hosted zone
  and specify the domain name. 
* You can then define the resource records for that domain. 
* If you use Route 53 to register a domain name, it automatically takes care of creating a public
  hosted zone for the domain.
* Route 53 can also provide name resolution for private domain names. A private domain
  name is one used on a network other than the internet.
* Route 53 private hosted zones
  provide DNS resolution for a single domain name within multiple VPCs.
* This is useful for
  assigning user-friendly domain names to VPC resources such as EC2 instances or application
  load balancers.
* Because private domain names aren’t accessible
  from the internet, there are no registrars, so you can pick any domain name you want.
* Name resolution for private hosted zones is not available outside of the VPC you select.

### Routing Policies

* In some cases, you just need a domain name to resolve to a particular IP address.
* But there are other times when you want the value of a resource record to change dynamically to
  work around failures or ensure users get pointed to the least busy server.

Route 53 lets you accomplish this with a variety of routing policies.

`Simple` The Simple routing policy is the default for new resource records. It simply lets you
map a domain name to a single static value, such as an IP address. It doesn’t check whether
the resource the record points to is available.

`Weighted` A Weighted policy distributes traffic across multiple resources according to a ratio.
For example, when introducing a new web server, you may want to route only 10 percent of
the traffic to the new server while evenly distributing the load across the rest.

`Latency` A Latency policy sends users to resources in the AWS Region that’s closest to
them. This is useful if, for instance, you want to send European users to the eu-west-1
region while sending users in the United States to the us-east-1 region.

`Failover` A Failover policy lets you route traffic to a primary resource unless it’s unavailable.
In that case, traffic will be redirected to a secondary resource.

`Geolocation` A Geolocation policy lets you route users based on their specific continent,
country, or state.

`Multivalue Answer` A Multivalue Answer policy allows you to evenly distribute traffic
across multiple resources. Unlike Weighted policies that return a single record, a Multivalue
Answer policy returns all records, sorted in a random order.


### Health Checks

* All routing policies with the exception of Simple can use health checks to determine
  whether they should route users to a given resource.
* A health check can check one of three
  things: an endpoint, a CloudWatch alarm, or another health check.
* All health checks occur every 10 seconds or 30 seconds.

`Endpoint` Endpoint health checks work by connecting to the endpoint you want to monitor
via HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP. Route 53 has health checkers in several AWS Regions, and
you can choose which health checkers a health check uses. This lets you ensure that an endpoint
is reachable from various locations around the world.

`CloudWatch alarm` A Route 53 health check can monitor the status of a CloudWatch
alarm. This is useful if you want to consider a resource unhealthy if it’s experiencing high
latency or is servicing a high number of connections.

`Calculated` This type of health check monitors the status of other health checks. For
example, if you want to consider the status of both an Endpoint health check and a
CloudWatch alarm health check, you can create a Calculated health check to take both
into account.


### Traffic Flow and Traffic Policies

* As an alternative to manually engineering routing policies, you can
  use the Route 53 Traffic Flow visual editor to create a diagram to represent the desired
  routing.
* The diagram you create represents a traffic policy that you can save and associate with
  a domain name by creating a policy record. Route 53 doesn’t create the individual resource
  records but instead hides the routing behind the single policy record.
* You can use the same routing policies that are available with normal resource records:
  Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Geolocation, and Multivalue Answer.
* Traffic Flow offers another routing policy that’s not otherwise available: Geoproximity.
* The Geoproximity routing policy lets you direct users to a resource based on how close
  they are to a geographic location.
* This differs from the Geolocation routing policy that
  routes based on the user’s specific continent, country, or state.

## CloudFront

* Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that helps deliver static and dynamic
  web content to users faster than just serving it out of an AWS Region.
* CloudFront solves this problem by caching your content in a number of data centers called `edge locations`.
* There are more than 150 edge locations spread out around the world on six continents.
* CloudFront works by sending users to the edge location that will give them the best performance.
  Typically, this is the edge location that’s physically closest to them.
* CloudFront also increases the availability of your content because copies of it are stored in multiple
  edge locations.
* As you might expect, the price of CloudFront increases as you utilize more edge locations. 
* You can’t select individual edge locations.


You must choose from the following three options:

* United States, Canada, and Europe
* United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Africa
* All edge locations

* To make your content available via CloudFront, you must create a distribution.
* A distribution defines the type of content you want CloudFront to cache, as well as the content’s
  origin—where CloudFront should retrieve the content from.


There are two types of distributions: Web and Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).


`Web` A Web distribution is the most common type. It’s used for static and dynamic content
such as web pages, graphic files, and live or on-demand streaming video. Users can
access Web distributions via HTTP or HTTPS. When creating a Web distribution, you
must specify an origin to act as the authoritative source for your content. An origin can be
a web server or a public S3 bucket. You can’t use nonpublic S3 buckets.


`RTMP` The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) delivers streaming video or audio
content to end users. To set up an RTMP distribution, you must provide both a media
player and media files to stream, and these must be stored in S3 buckets.


## Summary

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides the virtual network infrastructure for many AWS
resources, most notably EC2. VPCs can connect to other networks, including the following:
* The internet via an internet gateway
* External, private networks via Direct Connect or a virtual private network (VPN)
* Other VPCs using VPC peering

The Route 53 service provides two distinct but related Domain Name System (DNS) services.
* Route 53 functions as a registrar for many top-level internet domain names (TLDs).
* Route 53 also provides DNS hosting services. To use Route 53 with a public domain, you
  must create a public hosted zone. To use Route 53 for name resolution within a VPC, you
  must create a private hosted zone.

CloudFront is Amazon’s content delivery network (CDN). It improves delivery of data to
end users by storing content in edge locations around the world.
* CloudFront serves the content from the edge
  location that will give them the best performance.

## Exam Essentials

Know the components of a VPC. The key components of a VPC include at least one subnet,
security groups, network access control lists (NACLs), and internet gateways.

Understand the different options for connecting to resources in a VPC. You can connect
to resources in a VPC over the internet, a Direct Connect link, a VPC peering connection,
or a virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Understand the difference between a Route 53 public hosted zone and a private hosted zone.
A public hosted zone allows anyone on the internet to resolve records for the associated
domain name. A private hosted zone allows resolution only from resources within the associated
VPCs.

Be able to select the best Route 53 routing policy for a given scenario. All routing policies
except the Simple routing policy can use health checks to route around failures. If you want
to direct traffic to any available resource, Failover, Weighted, and Multivalue Answer routing
policies will suffice. If performance is a concern, choose a Latency routing policy. If you
need to direct users based on their specific location, use a Geolocation routing policy.

Know how CloudFront improves the speed of content delivery. CloudFront caches objects
in edge locations around the world and automatically directs users to the edge location that
will give them the best performance at any given time.

Be able to identify scenarios where CloudFront would be appropriate. CloudFront
is designed to give users the fastest possible access to content regardless of their physical
location. By caching content in edge locations that are distributed around the world,
CloudFront helps ensure that your content is always close to your users.
