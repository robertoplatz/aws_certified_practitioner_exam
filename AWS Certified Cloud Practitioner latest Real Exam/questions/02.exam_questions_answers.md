Q: What is an IAM role?
An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2.
Q: What problems do IAM roles solve?
IAM roles allow you to delegate access with defined permissions to trusted entities without having to share long-term access keys. You can use IAM. roles to delegate access to IAM users managed within your account, to IAM users under a different AWS account, or to an AWS service such as EC2.
Q: How do I get started with IAM roles?
You create a role in a way similar to how you create a userâ€”name the role and attach a policy to it. For details, see Creating IAM Roles.

**Question 64**

64. For 3 hours, 5 minutes, and 6 seconds, a client operates an Amazon Linux EC2 instance on-demand.How long will the consumer be charged?
*  A. 3 hours, 5 minutes
*  B. 3 hours, 5 minutes, and 6 seconds
*  C. 3 hours, 6 minutes
*  D. 4 hours

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
Today, customers may have use cases that require large number of instances running for irregular periods of time, such as dev/test, data processing, analytics, batch processing, image rendering and gaming applications. To improve flexibility and allow customers to focus on their application instead of maximizing usage to the hour, with EC2 per second billing, customers can start, stop; and terminate EC2 instances and take comfort in the fact that their EC2 resources will not be charged for the minutes and seconds remaining in the hours their instances were running.
This change is effective in all AWS Regions and is effective immediately, for Linux instances that are newly launched or already running. Per-second billing isnot currently applicable to instances running Microsoft Windows or Linux distributions that have a separate hourly charge.
List prices and Spot Market prices are still listed an a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second. With Reserved Instances usage you can launch, use, and terminate multiple instances within an hour and get the Reserved Instance Benefit for all of the instances. Bills will now show times in decimal form instead of in minutes and seconds.

CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

79. Which functionality may be utilized to prevent inadvertent overwrites or deletions of Amazon S3 buckets?
*  A. Lifecycle policy
*  B. Object versioning
*  C. Server-side encryption
*  D. Bucket ACL

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
53 Object Versioning is one of the most salient features in Amazon S3. Object versioning is used to avoid unintended overwrite and deletion. Versioning is not enabled by default and this featureis used to keep multiple versions of objects at the same time in the bucket.
If we enable versioning on the buckets we cannot delete an object directly. All versions remain in the bucket and a delete marker is introduced which becomes the current version. Sotif youneed to delete an object, you need to remove that delete marker also. Existing objects in your bucket do not change and only futurexequests behavior changes. If we put an object retrieval request, the current version of the object will always return.
