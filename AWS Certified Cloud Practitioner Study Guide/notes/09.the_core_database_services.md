# AWS Certified Practitioner Exam

## The Core Database Services

### Introduction

* Many applications use databases to store, retrieve, and organize data;
* The type of database you choose and how you configure it have a big impact on the performance and availability
  of such a database-backed application.
* It’s possible to build and run your own database
  servers in the cloud, but AWS offers another—and for many, better—option: managed
  database services.
* With a managed database service, you use the AWS Management Console or AWS command
  line interface (CLI) to provision a database.
* AWS handles the installation and maintenance
  of the database software, as well as database backups and replication.

You’ll learn about the following three different managed database
services provided by AWS:
* Relational database service (RDS);
* DynamoDB;
* Redshift;

### Database Models

* A database can use a relational or nonrelational model.
* The model you choose depends on how your application needs to store, organize, and retrieve data.
* It’s important to understand that the needs of the application determine the database model you choose;

#### Relational Databases

* Relational databases have been around a long time, and even if you’ve never created or
  maintained one, you’re already familiar with its fundamental concepts.
* A relational database is analogous to a spreadsheet that contains columns and rows.
* In a relational database, columns are called attributes , and rows are called records .
* Both are stored in a table , and a database can contain multiple tables.
* Another way that spreadsheets and relational databases differ is that you must predefi ne
  the type of data that can be stored in each column.
* An advantage of storing structured data in a relational database is that you can quickly
  search an entire database for specific values.
* You can also retrieve data from different tables
  and combine that data into virtually any format you can imagine.
* Relational databases are ideal for performing complex analytics and generating reports against large data
  sets.
* uses require multiple complex queries, and this is where relational databases excel.
* As a rule, the larger the database and the more complex the query, the longer it takes to
  retrieve the data you’re looking for.
* Database administrators frequently tune or optimize databases to ensure the best possible performance.
* Longer query times and increased maintenance are the price you pay for flexible queries.

#### Structured Query Language

* Relational databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL).
* You can use SQL statements to create databases and tables, as well as to read and write data.
* You can also perform tuning and maintenance tasks using SQL.

* The SELECT statement reads data from the database and controls how it’s formatted.
* To combine data from different tables, you add a JOIN clause to the SELECT statement.
* An application that uses a relational database will execute at least one SELECT statement every
  time it retrieves data from a database.


* The INSERT statement writes data to a table.
* You can think of this as programmatically adding data to individual cells in a spreadsheet.
* When an application writes data to a database, it uses the INSERT statement to do so.

#### Nonrelational (No-SQL) Databases

* Relational databases are wildly popular, but because of their restrictions, they’re also
  overly complex for applications that don’t need to store structured data.
* Also, relational databases often perform poorly when put under the strain of handling thousands of reads
  or writes per second.
* Nonrelational databases were developed to provide a fast alternative for applications
  that need to perform tens of thousands of reads or writes per second.
* In addition to being able to handle these high transaction rates, nonrelational databases let you store
  data that doesn’t have a well-defined, predictable structure.
* Such data is often called unstructured data, in contrast to the structure imposed on data by a relational database.
* Because of their unstructured nature, nonrelational or no-SQL databases are said to be
  schemaless.
* Nonrelational databases also store information in tables; tables are sometimes called
  collections, and each row or record is called an item.
* Nonrelational databases don’t require you to specify in advance all the types of data you’ll store.
* The only thing you have to define in advance is a primary key to uniquely identify each item.
* In exchange for the flexibility of storing unstructured data, the types of queries you can
  perform against that data are more limited.
* Nonrelational databases are designed to let you query items based on the primary key.
* Because the rest of the data doesn’t follow a predictable structure, a particular piece of data 
could be anywhere in the database.
* Hence, trying to query against any other data requires searching through every item in the entire table—
  a process that gets slower as the table grows.
* Nonrelational databases are best suited for
  applications that need to perform just a few well-defined queries.


### Amazon Relational Database Service

* The Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is Amazon’s managed relational database service.
* RDS lets you provision a number of popular relational database management systems
  (RDBMSs) including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
* When you create an RDS database instance, Amazon
  sets up one or more compute instances and takes care of installing and configuring the RDBMS
  of your choice.
* These compute instances are not EC2 instances that you can secure shell (SSH)
  into, but they are connected to a virtual private cloud (VPC) of your choice, allowing your
  applications running on AWS or on-premises to take full advantage of an RDS-hosted database.
* Like EC2 instances, RDS instances use Elastic Block Service (EBS) volumes for storage.
* To achieve the level of performance and availability you need, you can choose a multi-Availability
  Zone (multi-AZ) deployment to have database instances in multiple Availability
  Zones.
* RDS can also perform manual or automatic EBS snapshots that you can easily
  restore to new RDS instances.
* RDS can also handle the hard work of installing patches and
  upgrades during scheduled maintenance windows.

#### Database Engines

* When you create an RDS instance, you must choose a database engine, which is the specific
  RDBMS that will be installed on your instance.
* You can have only one database engine per
  instance, but you can provision multiple instances if need be

Amazon RDS supports the following six database engines:

* MySQL
* MariaDB
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Amazon Aurora


* With the exception of Amazon Aurora, these database engines are either open source or
  commercially available products found in many data center environments.
* Amazon Aurora is a proprietary database designed for RDS, but it’s compatible with existing MySQL and
  PostgreSQL databases.


#### Licensing

Depending on the database engine you choose, you must choose one of two licensing
options: license included or bring your own license (BYOL):

**License included** The license is included in the pricing for each RDS instance. The
Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle database engine options offer this license model. The
free database engines—MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL—exclusively use the license
included model.

**Bring your own license** In this model, you must provide your own license to operate the
database engine you choose. Unlike the license-included option, licensing costs are not built
into RDS pricing. This model is currently available only for Oracle databases.


#### Instance Classes

When you deploy an RDS instance, you must choose a database instance class that
defines the number of virtual CPUs (vCPU), the amount of memory, and the maximum
network and storage throughput the instance can support.

There are three instances classes you can choose from:
* Standard, 
* Memory Optimized, and 
* Burstable Performance.

##### Standard
The Standard instance class will meet the requirements of most applications. The latestgeneration
Standard instance class offers the following specs:
* Between 2 and 96 vCPU
* 8–384 GB memory

##### Memory Optimized

* The Memory Optimized instance class is for applications with the most demanding database
requirements.
* This class offers the most disk throughput and network bandwidth.
* Between 4 and 128 vCPU
* 122–3,904 GB memory

* Database instances use EBS storage.

##### Burstable Performance

* The Burstable Performance instance class is for nonproduction databases that have minimal
  performance requirements, such as those for test and development purposes.
* The latest generation Burstable Performance instance class has the lowest network bandwidth and
  disk throughput;
* Between 2 and 8 vCPU
* 1–32 GB memory


It can be difficult to predict exactly how many RDS instances you need and how much
compute power, memory, and network and storage throughput each of those instances
needs.

RDS makes it easy to right-size your database deployments in two ways:
scaling vertically and scaling horizontally.


#### Scaling Vertically

* Scaling vertically refers to changing the way resources are allocated to a specific instance.
* After creating an instance, you can scale up to a more powerful instance class to add more
  memory or improve computing or networking performance.
* Or you can scale down to a less powerful class to save on costs.


#### Storage

* The level of performance an RDS instance can achieve depends not only on the instance
  class you choose but also on the type of storage.
* New RDS instances use EBS volumes, and
  the maximum throughput a volume can achieve is a function of both the instance class and
  the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) the EBS volume supports.
* IOPS measure how fast you can read from and write to a volume. Higher IOPS generally means
  faster reads and writes.


RDS offers three types of storage: 
* general-purpose SSD, 
* provisioned IOPS SSD, 
* and magnetic.

##### General-Purpose SSD

* You can allocate a volume of between 20 GB and 32 TB.
* The number of IOPS per volume depends on how much storage you allocate.
* The more storage you allocate, the better your read and write performance will be.
* General-purpose SSD volumes can temporarily achieve a higher number of IOPS through a process called `bursting`.
* This way, you don’t have to allocate an excessive amount of storage just to get enough IOPS to meet peak demand.

##### Provisioned IOPS SSD

* Provisioned IOPS SSD storage allows you to specify the exact number of IOPS (in thousands)
  that you want to allocate per volume.
* Like general-purpose SSD storage, you can allocate up to 32 TB.
* Provisioned IOPS SSD storage doesn’t offer bursting, so it’s necessary to decide beforehand the maximum number of IOPS you’ll
  need.
* If your needs change, you can always adjust the number of IOPS later.

##### Magnetic

* Magnetic storage is available for backward compatibility with legacy RDS instances.
* It doesn’t use EBS, and you can’t change the size of a magnetic volume after you create it.
* Magnetic volumes are limited to 4 TB in size and 1,000 IOPS.
* You can also migrate from one storage type to another, but doing so can result in a short
  outage of typically a few minutes.
* But when migrating from magnetic to EBS storage, the
  process can take up to several days. During this time, the instance is still usable but may
  not perform optimally.


#### Scaling Horizontally with Read Replicas

* you can improve the performance of a database-backed application by adding additional RDS instances that perform only reads from the database.
* These instances are called read replicas.
* In a relational database, only the master database instance can write to the database.
* A read replica helps with performance by removing the burden of read-only queries from the master instance, freeing it up to focus on writes.
* Read replicas are also useful for running computationally intensive queries, such as monthly or quarterly reports
  that require reading and processing large amounts of data from the database.

#### High Availability with Multi-AZ
* Even if you use read replicas, only the master database instance can perform writes against
  your database.
* If that instance goes down, your database-backed application won’t be able
  to write data until it comes back online.
* To ensure that you always have a master database
  instance up and running, you can configure high availability by enabling the multi-AZ
  feature on your RDS instance.


* With multi-AZ enabled, RDS creates an additional instance called a standby database
  instance that runs in a different Availability Zone than your primary database instance.
* The primary instance instantly or synchronously replicates data to the secondary instance,
  ensuring that every time your application writes to the database, that data exists in multiple
  Availability Zones.

* With multi-AZ enabled, you can expect your database to achieve a monthly availability
  of 99.95 percent.
* It’s important to understand that an instance outage may occur for reasons
  other than an Availability Zone outage. 
* Routine maintenance tasks such as patching or
  upgrading the instance can result in a short outage and trigger a failover.
* If you use the Amazon Aurora database engine, you can take advantage of additional
  benefits when using multi-AZ.
* When you use Aurora, your RDS instances are part of an Aurora cluster.
* All instances in the cluster use a shared storage volume that’s synchronously
  replicated across three different Availability Zones.
* Also, if your storage needs increase, the
  cluster volume will automatically expand up to 64 TB.

#### Backup and Recovery

* Whether or not you use multi-AZ, RDS can take manual or automatic EBS snapshots of
  your instances.
* Snapshots are stored across multiple Availability Zones.
* This makes snapshots useful not only for backups but also for creating copies of a database for testing or development
  purposes.
* You can configure automatic snapshots to occur daily during a 30-minute backup window.
* RDS will retain automatic snapshots between 1 day and 35 days, with a default of 7 days.
* Enabling automatic snapshots also enables point-in-time recovery, a feature that saves
  your database change logs every 5 minutes.
* Combined with automated snapshots, this gives
  you the ability to restore a failed instance to within 5 minutes before the failure—losing no
  more than 5 minutes of data.


#### Determining Your Recovery Point Objective

* It’s important to understand that although both
  snapshots and multi-AZ protect your databases, they serve slightly different purposes.
* If your database encounters corruption, such as malicious deletion of records, snapshots let you recover that
  data, even if the corruption occurred days ago (provided you’re retaining the snapshots).
* Multi-AZ is designed to keep your database up and running in the event of an instance failure.
  To achieve this, data is synchronously replicated to a secondary instance.
* How much data loss you can sustain in the event of a failure is called the recovery point
  objective (RPO).
* If you can tolerate losing an hour’s worth of data, then your RPO would
  be 1 hour.
* To achieve such an RPO, simply using automatic snapshots with point-in-time
  recovery is sufficient.
* For an RPO of less than 5 minutes, you would also want to use multi-
  AZ to synchronously replicate your data to a secondary instance.


### DynamoDB

* DynamoDB is Amazon’s managed nonrelational database service.
* It’s designed for highly transactional applications that need to read from or write to a database tens of thousands
  of times a second.

#### Items and Tables

* The basic unit of organization in DynamoDB is an item, which is analogous to a row or
  record in a relational database.
* DynamoDB stores items in tables.
* Each DynamoDB table is stored across one or more partitions.
* Each partition is backed by solid-state drives, and partitions are replicated across multiple Availability Zones in a region, giving you a
  monthly availability of 99.99 percent.
* Each item must have a unique value for the primary key.
* An item can also consist of other key-value pairs called attributes.
* Each item can store up to 400 KB of data;
* Other than the primary key, an item doesn’t have to have any particular attributes.
* Hence, some items may contain several attributes, while others may contain only one or
  two.
* This flexibility makes DynamoDB the database of choice for applications that need
  to store a wide variety of data without having to know the nature of that data in advance.


Every attribute must have a defined data type, which can be one of the following:
**Scalar** A scalar data type has only one value and can be a string, a number, binary data,
or a Boolean value.


**Set** A set data type can have multiple scalar values, but each value must be unique within
the set.


**Document** The document data type is subdivided into two subtypes: list and map.
Document data types can store values of any type. List documents are ordered, whereas
map documents are not. Document data types are useful for storing structured data,
such as an IAM policy document stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

DynamoDB can recognize and extract specific values nested within a document, allowing
you to retrieve only the data you’re interested in without having to retrieve the entire
document.

#### Scaling Horizontally

* DynamoDB uses the primary key to distribute items across multiple partitions.
* Distributing the data horizontally in this fashion makes it possible for DynamoDB to consistently
  achieve low-latency reads and writes regardless of how many items are in a table.
* The number of partitions DynamoDB allocates to your table depends on the number of write
  capacity units (WCU) and read capacity units (RCU) you allocate to your table.
* The higher the transaction volume and the more data you’re reading or writing, the higher your RCU
  or WCU values should be.
* Higher values cause DynamoDB to distribute your data across
  more partitions, increasing performance and decreasing latency.
* As demand on your
  DynamoDB tables changes, you can change the number of RCU and WCU accordingly.
* Alternatively, you can configure DynamoDB Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust the number
  of WCU and RCU based on demand.
* This automatic horizontal scaling ensures consistent performance, even during times of peak load.



#### Queries and Scans

* Recall that nonrelational databases let you quickly retrieve items from a table based on the
  value of the primary key.
* Searching for a value in an attribute other than the primary key is possible, but slower.
* you’d have to perform a scan operation to list all items in the table.
* This is a read-intensive task that requires scanning every item in every partition your table is stored in.
* Even if you know all the attributes of an item except for the primary key, you’d still have to perform a scan operation to
  retrieve the item.

### Amazon Redshift

* Amazon Redshift is a specialized type of managed relational database called a data
  warehouse.
* A data warehouse stores large amounts of structured data from other relational
  databases and allows you to perform complex queries and analysis against that data.
* Redshift can combine data from financial, sales, and inventory databases into a
  single data warehouse and then analyze or generate reports on that data.
* Because data warehouses can grow quite large, they require a lot of storage.
* To use Redshift, you create a cluster consisting of at least one compute node and up to 128 nodes.
* Using dense compute nodes, you can store up to 326 TB of data on magnetic disks, and
  with dense storage nodes you can store up to 2 PB of data on SSDs.
* Redshift Spectrum is a feature of Redshift that lets you analyze data stored in S3.
* The data must be  structured, and you must define the structure so that Redshift can understand it.


### Summary

* If you’re migrating a database-backed application from your
  data center to AWS, chances are the application is already using a SQL database.
* In that case, your migration options are to either use RDS or build and maintain your own SQL
  server on one or more EC2 instances.
* Use a relational or nonrelational database is not an easy decision, nor is it always a clear-cut one.

* Note that the trade-off for being able to store unstructured data in a nonrelational database
  is being more limited in your queries.
* the reward for structuring your
  data and keeping it in a relational database is the flexibility to perform a wide variety of
  queries.
* Relational databases allow you to construct almost any query you can imagine.
* You can search based on any attribute, and even search for ranges;
* Nonrelational databases don’t offer this kind of query flexibility.


* Nonrelational databases such as DynamoDB are designed to scale horizontally by
  spreading your data across more partitions, allowing for thousands of reads and writes
  per second.
* Relational databases such as RDS can be scaled horizontally to support a high
  number of reads by adding read replicas.
* However, because only one database instance can
  write to the database, it’s not feasible to support higher write rates by scaling horizontally.
* Instead, you can scale the instance vertically by upgrading to a more powerful instance
  class.

### Exam Essentials

**Understand the major differences between relational and nonrelational databases.** 
Relational databases are designed for structured data that contains a defined number of attributes per
record. They let you perform complex queries against a variety of dimensions, making them
ideal for reporting and analytics. Nonrelational databases are designed for data that doesn’t
follow a predictable structure. Each item in a nonrelational database must have a primary key,
and you can query based on that key.


**Know the vertical and horizontal scaling options for RDS.** You can scale an RDS
instance vertically by upgrading to a larger instance class to give it more processing power,
memory, or disk or network throughput. You can also select provisioned IOPS SSD storage
to ensure your instance always achieves the storage performance it needs. For horizontal
scaling of reads, your only option is to use read replicas.


**Be able to describe the components of RDS.** An RDS deployment consists of at least
one instance. You must select an instance class that defines the vCPUs and memory for
the instance. You must also select a database engine. For storage, you must select generalpurpose
or provisioned IOPS SSD. Magnetic storage is a legacy option that’s not available
for new deployments. You can also add read replicas to scale horizontally to improve read
performance. In a multi-AZ deployment, you can add additional secondary instances that
the primary synchronously replicates data to.


**Know the backup and recovery options for RDS.** You can schedule automatic snapshots
for your RDS instance to occur daily during a 30-minute backup window of your choice.
Backups are retained between 1 day and 35 days. Enabling automatic backups also enables
point-in-time recovery, allowing the restoration of a failed database up to 5 minutes prior
to failure. Restoring from a snapshot entails creating a new instance from the snapshot.
You can also take a manual snapshot at any time.


**Understand how DynamoDB stores data.** DynamoDB stores data as items in tables.
Each item must have primary key whose values are unique within the table. This is how
DynamoDB uniquely identifies an item. The primary key’s name and data type must be
defined when the table is created. When you create an item, you can also add other attributes
in addition to the primary key. DynamoDB uses the primary key to distribute items
across different partitions. The number of partitions allocated to a table depends on the
number of WCU and RCU you configure.


**Be able to identify scenarios for using Redshift.** Redshift is a data-warehousing service for
storing and analyzing structured data from multiple sources, including relational databases
and S3. Redshift can store much more data than RDS, up to 2 PB!
