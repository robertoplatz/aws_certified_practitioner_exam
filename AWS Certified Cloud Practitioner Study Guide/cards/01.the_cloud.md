# AWS Certified Practitioner Exam

## The Cloud

**Card**  
What are the cloud computing features?

**Answer**
   * Highly Available and Scalable Resources
   * Professionally Secured Infrastructure
   * Metered Payment Mode

**Card**  
What meaning of Highly Available?

**Answer**
* Design multiple layers redundancy, whenever one component fails, workload moves instantly to a healthy replacement.
* Failure in one region, trigger a predefined relocation. This is supported rerouting the network requests.


**Card**  
What meaning of Scalable Resources?

**Answer**
* Provide customers compute power as they could possibly need, and deliver power on-demand.
* Because of the scale and efficiency of the platform, the price is often below what it could run locally.


**Card**  
What meaning of Professionally Secured Infrastructure?

**Answer**
* Your infra running locally, you are responsible for protecting the workstations, network hardware.
* The integrity of underlying server infrastructure is one potential area of vulnerability.
* AWS takes responsibility for the security of its platform when running in the cloud.


**Card**  
What meaning of Metered Payment Model?

**Answer**
* Public cloud computing automatically allocates resources to meet client requests.
* You are billed for only the testing time.
* Cost-cycle expenses will be considerably lower than they would if using physical servers running on premises.
* On premises infrastructure tends to be very capex-heavy.
* In cloud, involve virtually no capex costs at all, but operating expenses.


**Card**  
What meaning of Virtualization?

**Answer**
* AWS carves the necessary resources from larger existing devices.
* A 5 TB storage drive, for instance, be divided into dozens of smaller virtual volumes, each associated with a different virtual server.
* Resources of a single physical server could be invisibly shared between multiple instances.


**Card**  
What are the benefits of Virtualization?

**Answer**
* Speed
* Efficiency
Define, purchasing, provisioning, testing and launching new physical server can take months.
It's rare nonvirtualized physical server utilize near 100 percent of its capacity.


**Card**  
What are the cloud platform models?

**Answer**
* Infrastructure as a Service
* Platform as a Service
* Software as a Service
* Serverless Workloads


**Card**  
Define Infrastructure as a Service.

**Answer**
* Infrastructure as a Service products give you direct access to a provider's compute, storage and networking assets.
* The customer is responsible for the consequences of any bad configuration.

**Card**  
Define Platform as a Service.

**Answer**
* Platform as a Service products simplify the process of building an application, by hiding the complexity of the infrastructure that runs it.
* There are an interface which you define the behavior and environment you want for your application.


**Card**  
Define Software as a Service.

**Answer**
* Software as a Service (SaaS) products offer services meant to be accessed by end users. As illustrations, Google's Gmail service.
* Simple Email Service and Amazon WorkSpaces are example of SAAS.


**Card**  
What are the responsibility of customer and cloud platform across On Premises Deployment?

**Answer**
Customer:
* Application code
* Security
* Database
* OS
* Virtualization
* Networking
* Storage Hardware
* Server Hardware

Cloud Platform:
* none

**Card**  
What are the responsibility of customer and cloud platform across Platform as a Service?

**Answer**
Customer:
* Application code

Cloud Platform:
* Security
* Database
* OS
* Virtualization
* Networking
* Storage Hardware
* Server Hardware

**Card**

**Card**  
What meaning of Serverless Workloads?

**Answer**
* Serverless emulate traditional server behavior.
* Serverless allow individual developers run ther code for seconds or minutes at a time on some cloud servers.
* AWS Lambda is an example os serverless, that reacts to external events.



**Card**  
What difference between Scalability and Elasticity?

**Answer**
* A scalable service will automatically grow in capacity to seamlessly meet any changes in demand;
* The response might include automatically launching new server instances to add extra compute power to your cluster.
* In cloud like AWS, have endless available capacity;
* The limit and maximum size of your application normally is defined in your organization's budget.

* Elasticity when services are built to be easily and automatically resized.
* Services are added or removed automatically to meet changing usage demands.
* Generally, you set the maximum and minimum performance levels for your application.
