### Answers

1. B. The letter (a, b…) at the end of a designation indicates an Availability Zone. us-east-1
   would never be used for a Region in the western part of the United States.
2. D. The AWS GovCloud Region is restricted to authorized customers only. Asia Pacific
   (Tokyo) is a normal Region. AWS Admin and US-DOD don’t exist (as far as we know, at
   any rate).
3. D. EC2 instances will automatically launch into the Region you currently have selected.
   You can manually select the subnet that’s associated with a particular Availability Zone for
   your new EC2 instance, but there’s no default choice.
4. B, D. Relational Database Service (RDS) and EC2 both use resources that can exist in only
   one Region. Route 53 and CloudFront are truly global services in that they’re not located in
   or restricted to any single AWS Region.
5. C. The correct syntax for an endpoint is <service-designation>.<regiondesignation>.
      amazonaws.com—meaning, in this case, rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
6. B, C. For most uses, distributing your application infrastructure between multiple AZs
   within a single Region gives them sufficient fault tolerance. While AWS services do enjoy
   a significant economy of scale—bring prices down—little of that is due to the structure of
   their Regions. Lower latency and compliance are the biggest benefits from this list.
7. A. Sharing a single resource among Regions wouldn’t cause any particular security,
   networking, or latency problems. It’s a simple matter of finding a single physical host device
   to run on.
8. B. Auto Scaling is an important working element of application high availability, but it’s
   not what most directly drives it (that’s load balancing). The most effective and efficient
   way to get the job done is through parallel, load-balanced instances in multiple Availability
   Zones, not Regions.
9. A. “Data centers running uniform host types” would describe an edge location. The data
   centers within a “broad geographic area” would more closely describe an AWS Region. AZs
   aren’t restricted to a single data center.
10. C. Imposing virtual networking limits on an instance would be the job of a security group
    or access control list. IP address blocks are not assigned at the Region level. Customers have
    no access to or control over AWS networking hardware.
11. B. AWS displays AZs in (apparently) random order to prevent too many resources from
    being launched in too few zones.
12. D. Auto Scaling doesn’t focus on any one resource (physical or virtual) because it’s
    interested only in the appropriate availability and quality of the overall service. The job of
    orchestration is for load balancers, not autoscalers.
13. C. Resource isolation can play an important role in security, but not reliability. Automation
    can improve administration processes, but neither it, nor geolocation, is the most effective
    reliability strategy.
14. A, C. RDS database instances and Lambda functions are not qualified CloudFront origins.
    EC2 load balancers can be used as CloudFront origins.
15. D. CloudFront can’t protect against spam and, while it can complement your application’s
    existing redundancy and encryption, those aren’t its primary purpose.
16. B. Countering the threat of DDoS attacks is the job of AWS Shield. Protecting web
    applications from web-based threats is done by AWS Web Application Firewall. Using
    Lambda to customize CloudFront behavior is for Lambda Edge.
17. A, B. What’s in the cloud is your responsibility—it includes the administration of
    EC2-based operating systems.
18. C. There’s no one easy answer, as some managed services are pretty much entirely within
    Amazon’s sphere, and others leave lots of responsibility with the customer. Remember, “if
    you can edit it, you own it.”
19. D. The AWS Billing Dashboard is focused on your account billing issues. Neither the AWS
    Acceptable Use Monitor nor the Service Status Dashboard actually exists. But nice try.
20. B. The correct document (and web page https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) for this
    information is the AWS Acceptable Use Policy.
