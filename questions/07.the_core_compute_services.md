### Answers

1. C. An instance’s hardware profile is defined by the instance type. High-volume (or lowvolume)
   data processing operations and data streams can be handled using any storage
   volume or on any instance (although some may be better optimized than others).
2. A. The Quick Start includes only the few dozen most popular AMIs. The Community tab
   includes thousands of publicly available AMIs—whether verified or not. The My AMIs tab
   only includes AMIs created from your account.
3. B, C. AMIs can be created that provide both a base operating system and a pre-installed
   application. They would not, however, include any networking or hardware profile
   information—those are largely determined by the instance type.
4. B, D. c5d.18xlarge and t2.micro are the names of EC2 instance types, not instance type
   families.
5. D. A virtual central processing unit (vCPU) is a metric that roughly measures an instance
   type’s compute power in terms of the number of processors on a physical server. It has
   nothing to do with resilience to high traffic, system memory, or the underlying AMI.
6. A. An EC2 instance that runs on a physical host reserved for and controlled by a single
   AWS account is called a dedicated host. A dedicated host is not an AMI, nor is it an
   instance type.
7. C. A virtualized partition of a physical storage drive that is directly connected to the EC2
   instance it’s associated with is known as an instance store volume. A software stack archive
   packaged to make it easy to copy and deploy to an EC2 instance describes an EC2 AMI. It’s
   possible to encrypt EBS volumes, but encryption doesn’t define them.
8. C, D. Instance store volumes cannot be encrypted, nor will their data survive an instance
   shutdown. Those are features of EBS volumes.
9. B. Spot instances are unreliable for this sort of usage since they can be shut down
   unexpectedly. Reserved instances make economic sense where they’ll be used 24/7 over long
   stretches of time. “Dedicated” isn’t a pricing model.
10. D. Reserved instances will work here because your “base” instances will need to run 24/7
    over the long term. Spot and spot fleet instances are unreliable for this sort of usage since
    they can be shut down unexpectedly. On-demand instances will incur unnecessarily high
    costs over such a long period.
11. A. There’s no real need for guaranteed available capacity since it’s extremely rare for AWS
    to run out. You choose how you’ll pay for a reserved instance. All Upfront, Partial Upfront,
    and No Upfront are available options, and there is no automatic billing. An instance would
    never be launched automatically in this context.
12. A, C. Because spot instances can be shut down, they’re not recommended for applications
    that provide any kind of always-on service.
13. C, D. Elastic Block Store provides storage volumes for Lightsail and Beanstalk (and for
    EC2, for that matter). Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides application deployment, but
    no one ever accused it of being simple.
14. A. Beanstalk, EC2 (non-reserved instances), and RDS all bill according to actual usage.
15. B, D. Ubuntu is an OS, not a stack. WordPress is an application, not an OS.
16. B, C. Elastic Block Store is, for practical purposes, an EC2 resource. RDS is largely built
    on its own infrastructure.
17. A, C. While you could, in theory at least, manually install Docker Engine on either a
    Lightsail or EC2 instance, that’s not their primary function.
18. A, B. Both Lambda and Lightsail are compute services that—while they might possibly
    make use of containers under the hood—are not themselves container technologies.
19. D. Python is, indeed, a valid choice for a function’s runtime environment. There is no one
    “primary” language for Lambda API calls.
20. A. While the maximum time was, at one point, 5 minutes, that’s been changed to 15.
