### Answers

1. C. CloudFormation can create AWS resources and manages them collectively in a stack.
   Templates are written in the CloudFormation language, not Python. CloudFormation can’t
   create resources outside of AWS. It also doesn’t prevent manual changes to resources in a
   stack.
2. B, D. CloudFormation templates are written in the YAML or JSON format.
3. A. Parameters let you input customizations when creating a CloudFormation stack
   without having to modify the underlying template. Parameters don’t prevent stack updates
   or unauthorized changes. A template can be used to create multiple stacks, regardless of
   whether it uses parameters.
4. A, B. Resources CloudFormation creates are organized into stacks. When you update
   a stack, CloudFormation analyzes the relationships among resources in the stack and
   updates dependent resources as necessary. This does not, however, mean that any resource
   you create using CloudFormation will work as you expect. Provisioning resources using
   CloudFormation is not necessarily faster than using the AWS CLI.
5. A, C. CodeCommit is a private Git repository that offers versioning and differencing. It
   does not perform deployments.
6. B. Differencing lets you see the differences between two versions of a file, which can be
   useful when figuring out what change introduced a bug. Versioning, not differencing, is
   what allows reverting to an older version of a file. Differencing doesn’t identify duplicate
   lines of code or tell you when an application was deployed.
7. D. Continuous integration is the practice of running code through a build or test process
   as soon as it’s checked into a repository. Continuous delivery and continuous deployment
   include continuous integration but add deployment to the process. Differencing only shows
   the differences between different versions of a file but doesn’t perform any testing.
8. B, D. Build.general1.medium and build.general1.large support Windows and Linux
   operating systems. Build.general1.small supports Linux only. The other compute types
   don’t exist.
9. A, B. A CodeBuild build environment always contains an operating system and a Docker
   image. It may contain the other components but doesn’t have to.
10. A, B, C. CodeDeploy can deploy application files to Linux or Windows EC2 instances
    and Docker containers to ECS. It can’t deploy an application to smartphones, and it can’t
    deploy files to an S3 bucket.
11. B. At the very least, a CodePipeline must consist of a source stage and a deploy stage.
12. D. A launch template can be used to launch instances manually and with EC2 Auto
    Scaling. A launch configuration can’t be used to launch instances manually. An instance
    role is used to grant permissions to applications running on an instance. Auto Scaling can’t
    provision instances using a CloudFormation template.
13. A, D. The maximum and minimum group size values limit the number of instances in an
    Auto Scaling group. The desired capacity (also known as the group size) is the number
    of instances that Auto Scaling will generally maintain, but Auto Scaling can launch or
    terminate instances if dynamic scaling calls for it.
14. B. Auto Scaling will use self-healing to replace the failed instance to maintain the desired
    capacity of 7. Terminating an instance or failing to replace the failed one will result in
    6 instances. Auto Scaling won’t ever change the desired capacity in response to a failed
    instance.
15. A. Predictive scaling creates a scheduled scaling action based on past usage patterns.
    Scheduled scaling and dynamic scaling do not create scheduled scaling actions. There is no
    such thing as pattern scaling.
16. B. A Command document can execute commands on an EC2 instance. An Automation
    document can perform administrative tasks on AWS, such as starting or stopping an
    instance. There is no such thing as a Script document or a Run document.
17. D. An Automation document can perform administrative tasks on AWS, such as starting or
    stopping an instance. A Command document can execute commands on an EC2 instance.
    There is no such thing as a Script document or a Run document.
18. B. AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses Chef recipes, while AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise
    uses Puppet modules. There is no service called AWS OpsWorks Layers or AWS OpsWorks
    for Automation.
19. B, D. OpsWorks supports the Puppet Enterprise and Chef configuration management
    platforms. It doesn’t support SaltStack, Ansible, or CFEngine.
20. C. Only an OpsWorks layer contains at least one EC2 instance. There’s no such thing as an
    EC2 Auto Scaling layer.
