### Answers

1. C. AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.

2. A. Use Dedicated Hosts to launch Amazon EC2 instances on physical servers that are dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts give you additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server, and you can reliably use the same physical server over time. As a result, Dedicated Hosts enable you to use your existing server-bound software licenses like Windows Server and address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.

3. C. Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. This shared model can help relieve the customer's operational burden as
   AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates.

4. D. Cloud services main proposition is to provide elasticity through horizontal scaling. Its already there. As for using largest instance possible, it is not a design principle that helps cloud applications in anyway. Scrum development process is not related to architecting. Therefore, a key principle is to provision your application for on-demand capacity. Peak loads is something that cloud applications experience everyday. Peak load management should be a necessary part of cloud application design principle.

    The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operation, and continuously improve.supporting processes and procedures to delivery business value. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper.
    Design Principles
    There are five design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:
    •	Perform operations as code a
    •	Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    •	Refine operations procedures frequently
    •	Anticipate failure ti
    •	Learn from all operational failures

13. C.
14. A. Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. This shared model can help relieve the customer's operational burden as AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates. The customer assumes responsibility and management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), other associated application software as well as the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall. Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as their responsibilities vary depending on the services used, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. The nature of this shared responsibility also provides the flexibility and customer control that permits the deployment. As shown in the chart below, this differentiation of responsibility is commonly referred to as Security "of" the Cloud versus Security "in" the Cloud.

18. A. AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers can access core security checks

19. C.
20. C. Service Control Policies (SCPs) are IAM-like policies to manage permissions in AWS Organizations. SCPs restrict the actions allowed for accounts within the organization making each one of them compliant with your guidelines.

21. A. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your
    AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. This enables you to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting.

22. D. AWS measures durability as a percentage. For example, the S3 Standard Tier is designed
    for 99.999999999% durability.

23. B. Patch Management: AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications

24. D. Shared Controls which apply to both the infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in completely separate
    contexts or perspectives. In a shared control, AWS provides the requirements for the infrastructure and the
    customer must provide their own control implementation within their use of AWS services.
    Examples include:
    ,s, Patch Management AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications.
    IDD Configuration Management AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.

25. B. The more loosely coupled the
    application components are, the better they will scale.

26. B. Elasticity - AWS Well-Architected Framework Elasticity The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.

27. A. An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and
    connectivity in an AWS Region. AZs give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.

28. A. You can use versions to manage the deployment of your functions. For example, you can publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of the stable production version. Lambda creates a new version of your function each time that you publish the function. The new version is a copy of the unpublished version of the function.

    Q: What is an IAM role?
    An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2.
    Q: What problems do IAM roles solve?
    IAM roles allow you to delegate access with defined permissions to trusted entities without having to share long-term access keys. You can use IAM. roles to delegate access to IAM users managed within your account, to IAM users under a different AWS account, or to an AWS service such as EC2.
    Q: How do I get started with IAM roles?
    You create a role in a way similar to how you create a user—name the role and attach a policy to it. For details, see Creating IAM Roles.

63. C. AWS Artifact provides on-demand downloads of AWS security and compliance documents, such as AWS ISO certifications, Payment Card Industry (PCI), and Service Organization Control (SOC) reports. You can submit the security and compliance documents (also known as audit artifacts) to your auditors or regulators to demonstrate the security and compliance of the AWS infrastructure and services that you use.

64. B. Today, customers may have use cases that require large number of instances running for irregular periods of time, such as dev/test, data processing, analytics, batch processing, image rendering and gaming applications. To improve flexibility and allow customers to focus on their application instead of maximizing usage to the hour, with EC2 per second billing, customers can start, stop; and terminate EC2 instances and take comfort in the fact that their EC2 resources will not be charged for the minutes and seconds remaining in the hours their instances were running.
    This change is effective in all AWS Regions and is effective immediately, for Linux instances that are newly launched or already running. Per-second billing isnot currently applicable to instances running Microsoft Windows or Linux distributions that have a separate hourly charge.
    List prices and Spot Market prices are still listed an a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second. With Reserved Instances usage you can launch, use, and terminate multiple instances within an hour and get the Reserved Instance Benefit for all of the instances. Bills will now show times in decimal form instead of in minutes and seconds.

79. B. 53 Object Versioning is one of the most salient features in Amazon S3. Object versioning is used to avoid unintended overwrite and deletion. Versioning is not enabled by default and this featureis used to keep multiple versions of objects at the same time in the bucket.
    If we enable versioning on the buckets we cannot delete an object directly. All versions remain in the bucket and a delete marker is introduced which becomes the current version. Sotif youneed to delete an object, you need to remove that delete marker also. Existing objects in your bucket do not change and only futurexequests behavior changes. If we put an object retrieval request, the current version of the object will always return.

     A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network in your own logically isolated area in the AWS Cloud. Use separate VPCs to isolate infrastructure by workload or organizational entity.
     A subnet is a range of IP addresses in a VPC. When you launch an instance, you launch it into a subnet in your VPC. Use subnets to isolate the tiers of your application (for example, web, application, and database) within a single VPC. Use private subnets for your instances if they should not be accessed directly from the Internet.
     To call the Amazon EC2 API from your VPC without sending traffic over the public internet, use AWS PrivateLink.

119. CE. Automatically recover from failure: By monitoring a workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can trigger automation when a threshold is breached. These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the technical aspects of the operation of the service. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of faillkes, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it's possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.
     Test recovery procedures: In an on-premises.environment, testing is often conducted to prove that the workload works inia particular scenario. Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies. In the cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can validate your recovery procedures. You can use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before. This approach exposes failure pathways that you can test and fix before a real failure scenario occurs, thus reducing risk.

For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider -- and its not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly. If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that). AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. Its a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.

149. B. Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.
