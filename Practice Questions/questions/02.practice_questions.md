You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate billing and payment
for multiple AWS accounts. With consolidated billing you get:
- One bill for multiple accounts
- Easy tracking or charges across accounts.
  Combined usage across accounts and sharing of volume pricing discounts, reserved instance
  discounts and savings plans.
- No extra fee.
  CORRECT: "They will receive one bill for the accounts in the Organization" is a correct answer.
  CORRECT: "They may benefit from lower unit pricing for aggregated usage" is also a correct answer.
  INCORRECT: "The default service limits in all accounts will be increased" is incorrect. This is not true;
  service limit defaults are unaffected.
  INCORRECT: "They will receive a fixed discount for all usage across accounts" is incorrect. There is no
  fixed usage discount applied for consolidated billing.

INCORRECT: "They will be automatically enrolled in a business support plan" is incorrect. This is not
true; you must always pay for the business support plan.



**Question 53**

53.  Which design principles are enabled by the AWS Cloud to improve the operation of workloads? (Select TWO.)
*  A. Customized hardware
*  B. Loose coupling
*  C. Remove single points of failure
*  D. Minimum viable product
*  E. Minimize platform design

**Answer** B, C

**Explanation**  
Loose coupling is when you break systems down into smaller components that are loosely
coupled together. This reduces interdependencies between systems components. This is
achieved in the cloud using messages buses, notification and messaging services.
Removing single points of failure ensures fault tolerance and high availability. This is easily
achieved in the cloud as the architecture and features of the cloud support the implementation
of highly available and fault tolerant systems.
CORRECT: "Loose coupling" is a correct answer.
CORRECT: "Remove single points of failure" is alSo a correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Customized hardware" is incorrect. You cannot customize hardware in the cloud.
INCORRECT: "Minimize platform design" is incorrect. This is not an operational advantage for
workloads in the cloud.
INCORRECT: "Minimum viable product" is incorrect. This is not an operational advantage for
workloads in the cloud.



**Question 54**

54.  A company plans to deploy a relational database on AWS. The IT department will perform database administration. Which service should the company use?
*  A. Amazon DynamoDB
*  B. Amazon EC2
*  C. Amazon RedShift
*  D. Amazon ElastiCache

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
A self-managed relational database can be installed on Amazon EC2. When using this
deployment you can choose the operating system and instance type that suits your
needs and then install and manage any database software you require.
table below helps you to understand when to use different types of database
deployment:
CORRECT: "Amazon ECT' is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Amazon RedShift" is incorrect. RedShift√•s managed data warehouse
solution and is better suited to use cases where analytics of data is required.
INCORRECT: "Amazon ElastiCache" is incorrect. ElastiCache is a managed service for
in-memory, high-performance caching of database content.
INCORRECT: "Amazon DynamoDB" is incorrect. DynamoDB is a non-relational (NoSQL)
type of database.



**Question 55**

55.  A company runs a batch job on an Amazon EC2 instance and it takes 6 hours to complete. The workload is expected to double in volume each month with a proportional increase in processing time. What is the most efficient cloud architecture to address the growing workload?
*  A. Run the batch workload in parallel across multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
*  B. Run the application on a bare metal Amazon EC2 instance.
*  C. Change the Amazon EC2 volume type to a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume.
*  D. Run the batch job on a larger Amazon EC2 instance type with more CPU.

**Answer** A

**Explanation**  
The most efficient option is to use multiple EC2 instances and distribute the workload across
them. This is an example of horizontal scaling and will allow the workload to keep growing in
size without any issue and without increasing the overall processing timeframe.
CORRECT: Run the batch workload in parallel across multiple Amazon EC2 instances" is the
correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Run the batch job on a larger Amazon EC2 instance type with more CPU" is
incorrect. This may help initially but over time this will not scale well and the workload will
take many days to complete.
INCORRECT: "Change the Amazon EC2 volume type to a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume" is
incorrect. This will improve the underlying performance of the EBS volume but does not assist
with processing (more CPU is needed, i.e. by spreading across instances).
INCORRECT: "Run the application on a bare metal Amazon EC2 instance" is incorrect. Bare metal
instances are used for workloads that require access to the hardware feature set (such as Intel
VT-x), for applications that need to run in non-virtualized environments for licensing support
requirements, or for customers who wish to use their own hypervisor.



**Question 56**

56.  A user is planning to launch three EC2 instances behind a single Elastic Load Balancer. The deployment should be highly available.
*  A. Launch the instances as EC2 Spot Instances in the same AWS Region and the same   Availability Zone.
*  B. Launch the instances as EC2 Reserved Instances in the same AWS Region, but in   different Availability Zones.
*  C. Launch the instances in multiple AWS Regions, and use Elastic IP addresses.
*  D. Launch the instances across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region.

**Answer** D

**Explanation**  
To make the deployment highly available the user should launch the instances across multiple
Availability Zones in a single AWS Region. Elastic Load Balancers can only serve targets in a
single Region so it i? not possible to deploy across Regions.
CORRECT: "Launch the instances across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region" is
the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Launch the instances as EC2 Spot Instances in the same AWS Region and the same
Availability Zone" is incorrect. The pricing model is not relevant to high availability and
deploying in a single AZ does not result in a highly available deployment.
INCORRECT: "Launch the instances in multiple AWS Regions, and use Elastic IP addresses" is
incorrect. You cannot use an ELB with instances in multiple Regions and using an EIP does not
help.
INCORRECT: "Launch the instances as EC2 Reserved Instances in the same AWS Region; but in
different Availability Zones" is incorrect. Using reserved instances may not be appropriate as
we do not know whether this is going to be a long-term workload or not.



**Question 57**

57.  A company was many underutilized compute resources on-premises. Which AWS Cloud feature will help resolve this issue?
*  A. Global deployment
*  B. Elasticity
*  C. Fault tolerance
*  D. High availability

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
Elasticity can resolve the issue of underutilization as you can easily and automatically
adjust the resource allocations for your compute resources based on actual utilization.
This ensures that you have the right amount of resources and do not pay for more than
you need.
CORRECT: "Elasticity" is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "High availability" is incorrect. This dys not help with resolving
under utilization.
INCORRECT: "Fault tolerance" is incorrect. This does not help with resolving
under utilization.
INCORRECT: "Global deployment" is incorrect. This does not help with resolving
under utilization.



**Question 58**

58.  A Cloud Practitioner requires point-in-time recovery (PITR) for an Amazon DynamoDB table. Who is responsible for configuring and performing backups?
*  A. AWS is responsible for configuring and the user is responsible for performing   backups.
*  B. AWS is responsible for both tasks.
*  C. The customer is responsible for both tasks.
*  D. The customer is responsible for configuring and AWS is responsible for performing backups.

**Answer** D

**Explanation**  
Point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides continuous backups of your DynamoDB table data. When
enabled, DynamoDB maintains incremental backups of your table for the last 35 days until you
explicitly turn it off. It is a customer Responsibility to enable PITR on and AWS is responsible for
actually performing the backups.
CORRECT: "The customer is responsible for configuring and AWS is responsible for performing
backups" is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "AWS is responsible for configuring and the user is responsible for performing
backups" is incorrect. This is backwards, users are responsible for configuring and AWS is
responsible for performing backups.
INCORRECT: "AWS is responsible for both tasks" is incorrect. This is not true as users must
configure PITR.
INCORRECT: "The customer is responsible for both tasks" is incorrect. This is not true, AWS
perform the backups.



**Question 59**

59.  AWS are able to continually reduce their pricing due to:
*  A. Compute savings plans.
*  B. Elastic compute services.
*  C. Economies of scale.
*  D. Pay-as-you go pricing.

**Answer** C

**Explanation**  
By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on
your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in
the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which
translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
CORRECT: "economies of scale" is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "pay-as-you go pricing" is incorrect. This is a benefit to the customer but
is not the reason the actual unit prices are continually being reduce.
INCORRECT: "elastic compute services" is incorrect. Elasticity is useful for scaling your
resources and aligning costs with demand but is not why AWS prices are being
lowered.
INCORRECT: "compute savings plans" is incorrect. This is another feature you can take
advantage of for bigger discounts but is not the reason for prices being lowered.



**Question 60**

60.  When running applications in the AWS Cloud, which common tasks can AWS manage on behalf of their customers? (Select TWO.)
*  A. Patching database software
*  B. Taking a backup of a database
*  C. Application security testing
*  D. Application source code auditing
*  E. Creating a database schema

**Answer** A, B

**Explanation**  
With AWS managed services you can reduce your time spent performing common IT tasks.
With services such as Amazon RD*AWS will patch the database host operating system and
database software and perform patch management activities.
CORRECT: "Patching database software" is a correct answer.
CORRECT: "Taking a backup of a database" is also a correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Application source code auditing" is incorrect AWS does not audit your source
code. You can use Amazon CodeGuru for recommendations for improvement though.
INCORRECT: "Creating a database schema" is incorrect. AWS does not create your schema;
this is something that's in the customer's control.
INCORRECT: "Application security testing" is incorrect. AWS does not perform any security
testing of your applications.

*  D. AWS Direct Connect

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely
delivers data, videos, application?, and APIs to customers globally with low latency,
high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.
CORRECT: "Amazon CloudFront" is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "AWS Direct Connect" is incorrect. Direct Connect is a private network
connection between an on-premises center and AWS.
INCORRECT: "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling" is incorrect. Auto Scaling launches and
terminates instances, this does not reduce latency for global users.
INCORRECT: "Amazon ElastiCache" is incorrect. ElastiCache is a database caching
service, it is not used to cache websites.



**Question 62**

62.  How does the AWS cloud increase the speed and agility of execution for customers? (Select TWO.)
*  A. Scalable compute capacity
*  B. Lower cost of deployment
*  C. Private connections to data centers
*  D. Secured data centers
*  E. Fast provisioning of resources

**Answer** A, E

**Explanation**  
The ability to quickly provision resources on AWS is a good example of speed and agility. On
AWS the resources are readily available and can be deployed extremely quickly. Scalable
compute capacity is another example as it gives you the agility to easily reconfigure your
resources with more or less capacity as is required.
CORRECT: "Fast provisioning of resources" is a correct answer.
CORRECT: "Scalable compute capacity" is also a correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Private connections to data centers" is incorrect. A private connection to a data
center is not an example of speed and agility.
INCORRECT: "Secured data centers" is incorrect. Secured data centers are not an example of
speed and agility.
INCORRECT: "Lower cost of deployment" is incorrect. This is not an example of speed and
agility.



**Question 63**

63.  An individual IAM user must be granted access to an Amazon S3 bucket using a bucket policy. Which element in the S3 bucket policy should b√© updated to define the user account for which access will be granted?
*  A. Resource
*  B. Principal
*  C. Condition
*  D. Action

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
The Principal element specifies the user, account, service, or other entity that is allowed
or denied access to a resource. The bucket policy below has a Principal element set to *
which is a wildcard meaning any user. To grant access to a specific IAM user the following
format can be used:
CORRECT: "Principal" is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Action" is incorrect. Actions are the permiSsions that you can specify in a
policy.
INCORRECT: "Resource" is incorrect. Resources are the ARNs of resources you wish to
specify permissions for.
INCORRECT: "Condition" is incorrect. Conditions define certain conditions to apply when
granting permissions such as the source IP address of the caller.

*  C. Security group rules
*  D. AWS Secrets Manager
*  E. Strong password policies

**Answer** B, E

**Explanation**  
For extra security, AWS recommends that you require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users in your account.
With MFA, users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge.
Both, the user's credentials (something you know) and the device-generated response (something you have) are
required to complete the sign-in process. If a user's password or access keys are compromised, your account
resources are still secure because of the additional authentication requirement.
Additionally, strong password policies should be used to enforce measures including minimum password length,
complexity, and password reuse restrictions.
CORRECT: "AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MF√Ö)" is a correct answer.
CORRECT: "Strong password policies" is also a correct answer.
INCORRECT: "AWS Secrets Manager" is incorrect. This service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve
