**Question 29**

29.  An application uses a PostgreSQL database running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. A Cloud Practitioner has been asked to increase the availability of the database so there is automatic recovery in the case of a failure. Which tasks can the Cloud Practitioner take to meet this requirement?
*  A. Set the DeleteOnTermination value to false for the EBS root volume.
*  B. Configure EC2 Auto Recovery to move the instance to another Region.
*  C. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS and enable the Multi-AZ feature.
*  D. Configure an Elastic Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instance.

**Answer** C

**Explanation**  
Moving the database to Amazon RDS means that the database can take advantage of the
built-in Multi-AZ feature. This feature creates a standby instance in another Availability Zone
and synchronously replicates to it. In the event of a failure that affects the primary database an
automatic failover can occur and the database will become functional on the standby instance.
CORRECT: "Migrate the database to Amazon RDS and enable the Multi-AZ feature" is the correct
answer.
INCORRECT: "Configure an Elastic Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instance" is incorrect. You
cannot use an ELB to distribute traffic to a database and with a single instance there's no
benefit here at all.
INCORRECT: "Configure EC2 Auto Recovery to move the instance to another Region" is incorrect.
The auto recovery feature of EC2 automatically moves the instance to another host, not to
another Region.
INCORRECT: "Set the DeleteOnTermination value to false for the EBS root volume" is incorrect.
This will simply preserve the root volume; it will not perform automatic recovery



**Question 30**

**Question 32**

32.  A company uses Amazon EC2 instances to run applications that are dedicated to different departments. The company needs to break out the costs of these applications and allocate them to the relevant department. The FC2 instances run in a single VPC. How can the company achieve these requirements?
*  A. Enable billing access for IAM users and view the costs in Cost Explorer.
*  B. Add additional Amazon VPCs and launch each application in a separate VPC.
*  C. Enable billing alerts through Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS.
*  D. Create tags by department on the instances and then run a cost allocation report.

**Answer** D

**Explanation**  
The company should create cost allocation tags that specify the department and assign
them to resources. These tags must be activated so they are visible in the cost allocation
report. Once this is done and a monthly cost allocation report has been configured it will
be easy to monitor the costs for each department.
CORRECT: "Create tags by department on the instances and then run a cost allocation
report" is the correct answer.
INCORRECT: "Enable billing access for IAM users and view the costs in Cost Explorer" is
incorrect. Cost explorer will not show a breakdown Of the costs by department.
INCORRECT: "Enable billing alerts through Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS" is
incorrect. A billing alert simply lets you know you have reached a cost threshold.
