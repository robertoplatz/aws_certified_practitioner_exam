**Question 136**

136. What is AWS Storage Gateway's purpose?
*  A. It ensures on-premises data storage is 99.999999999% durable.
*  B. It transports petabytes of data to and from AWS.
*  C. It connects to multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
*  D. It connects on-premises data storage to the AWS Cloud.

**Answer** D

**Explanation**  
Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch. For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider -- and its not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly. If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that). AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. Its a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.

**Question 139**

139. Which AWS service enables conventional SQL queries against stored datasets straight from Amazon S3?
*  A. AWS Glue
*  B. AWS Data Pipeline
*  C. Amazon CloudSearch
*  D. Amazon Athena

**Answer** D

**Explanation**  
Amazon Athena is defined as an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyse data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. So, its another SQL query engine for large data sets stored in S3. This is very similar to other SQL query engines, such as Apache Drill. But unlike Apache Drill, Athena is limited to data only from Amazon's own S3 storage service. However, Athena is able to query a variety of file formats, including, but not limited to CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.

*  B. Reliability
*  C. Performance
*  D. Agility

**Answer** D

CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting. In addition, you can use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts. These capabilities help simplify operational analysis and troubleshooting.

*  A. Connect to each database instance on a monthly basis, and download and apply the necessary security patches from the vendor.
*  B. Enable automatic patching for the instances using the Amazon RDS console.
*  C. In AWS Config, configure a rule for the instances and the required patch level.
*  D. Use AWS Systems Manager to automate database patching according to a schedule.

*  C. It is granting AdministratorAccess policy permissions to trustworthy users.
*  D. It is granting only the permissions required to perform a given task.

**Answer** D

**Explanation**  
When you create IAM policies, follow the standard security advice of granting least privilege, or granting only the permissions required to perform a task.
Determine what users (and roles) need to do and then craft policies that allow them to perform only those tasks.


**Question 149**

149. When building an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance in Multiple Availability Zone mode, which architectural concept is followed?
*  A. Implement loose coupling.
*  B. Design for failure.
*  C. Automate everything that can be automated.
*  D. Use services, not servers.

**Answer** B

**Explanation**  
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.
